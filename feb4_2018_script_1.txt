paidrebooter, Great shot. Where are you in the picture?
vinnybankroll, Carnival is a client of mine. Gonna forward this to them. Love it. 
SplendidHippo, What was your altitude here? Looks like close to 800 ft / 240m. 
frequentpooper, Man, that water is really blue. Did you do any post-processing on the image?
mr_ekan, Looks nice!
SilentGuardian3, I've been wanting to get a shot like this. If I am allowed to fly in the airspace, is it legal to get a shot like this or the "chasing" a cruise ship shots? 
itsdatoneguy, Was the boat moving and you were on the cruise? Or was it docked? 
LionWaffles, Beautiful!
Mkirk467, Nice!
None, [deleted]
None, I wanted to bring my phantom 3 on my cruise but couldn't find the rules for it so just decided not to bring it. Was there any process to bring it along with you? 
lispychicken, I imagined a cruise ship to be a lot bigger than that. Seems small to me, but i have zero cruise experience
Vipre7, Awesome shot! Too bad it's a Carnival ship and not one of the newer, amazing ships from Celebrity or Royal Caribbean. I've been on a few dozen cruises and Carnival is by far, light years behind Celebrity and Royal Caribbean in terms of entertainment, food, service, customer ratings, etc. I always wanted to see a drone shot of one of the new "observation pods" which is like a sky pod thingy that lifts you up way above the ship. Some of these newer cruise ships have huge water slides that would look awesome from a drone's perspective! 
ablack82, I'm out of frame on shore
ablack82, Let me know if they are pissed or if they enjoy it. 
ablack82, I can check later but if I remember correctly it was around 900'
ablack82, Increased contrast slightly to bring out colors on the deck but that's about it, the blue is almost the same just straight off the camera 
ablack82, Read all the comments of people yelling at me.... in the US FAA regulations say you shouldn't do this but it really doesn't matter. You are not supposed to fly over 400 feet, you're not supposed to fly over people etc... but in reality there isn't going to be someone stopping you. So it comes down to if you want to risk it or not. 
drwuzer, Looks like it must be anchored as there is a tender along side of it.  He said he's in Grand Cayman,  most of the big ships anchor off shore there and tender people back and forth.   
ablack82, It was at port in Grand Cayman, about a mile off shore, I flew out there from shore 
drwuzer, > you could literally kill multiple people when it falls.

That's being really dramatic there bud.  Please provide a single instance where a consumer grade drone like the phantom 3, dropped from the sky and KILLED anyone.    There are MILLIONS of these drones in use, I can't find a single instance where anyone has been KILLED by one. (Incidents where a drone has caused a car crash don't count)
EasyiceFPV, Maybe <20% chance of landing on the boat after free fall given altitude and atmosphere. Some drone safety arguments are like abstinence education... let's focus on practical safety! If it loses a motor or prop... aim for the water!
ablack82, The chances of anything happening are so astronomically small, the drone would have to completely fail and chances of that are definitely less than 1%. Once the drone completely fails which is again unlikely, it would have to fall directly on a person which is such a small area compared to the size of the ship. The wind was blowing around 20 mph from port to starboard, so while falling ~1,000  feet down it would miss the ship. 

I completely understand that there is a chance someone could be hurt but I would be willing to bet those chances are almost completely negligible. 
ablack82, Port at Grand Cayman is not international waters. Questionable legality. 
None, [removed]
ablack82, I was staying in Grand Cayman, I would not try to bring it on the ship as I would imagine that would not be allowed.
Supes_man, I think you're missing a sense of scale. See those tiny blue strips? Those are those sun tanning bed things that people lay on. These ships are HUGE. 
ablack82, It is the Carnival Glory, it is 952' long or over 3 football fields. 
Supes_man, Found the guy who works for Royal Caribbean everyone.
kainxavier, ...he said, crying.
vinnybankroll, haha i work on the marketing side of things and i think as far as they are concerned, a beautiful photo of their ship is good publicity. the crew on the other hand... 
i'll let you know if i hear anything
SplendidHippo, Nice. My trig is a little rusty :)
LionWaffles, How do you get it to go 900 feet (where legal) because mine just says "MAX ALT" whenever I go to 398, or will it be automatic wherever I am?
ChrisM0678, Looks amazing, if I may offer advice, next time sample the white or black to color correct instead of kicking up saturation.
SilentGuardian3, Yea that's what I thought too....great shot dude 
drwuzer, That's cool man,  did you sail to grand cayman on that boat or do you live there?   Wondering if you had any issues getting the drone on board the boat or through customs.  
ZiiC, 100% agree with you, the was very dramatic lol..
justamomento, The totality of what's written here isn't dramatic at all. Looks like he went out of his way to be polite yet firm. Safety is a HUGE thing we should be attentive to in the drone community, sure the phrasing could have been a little different but this isn't anything close to alarmist.
Supes_man, Dramatic? I felt it was stated reasonably. 

If it falls on someone from up in the air like that? Yes it would kill a person. It's just basic logic and reasoning that tells us that. Doesn't matter where or when it's happened before, the risk/reward ratio is nowhere near close to worth it. 
Casban, If it's got 4 rotors and you lose one... what is this 'aim' you speak of? I don't think control is a thing anymore...
Supes_man, I'm not saying that it's going to happen. There's just a reason it's illegal in the US, because the potential downside is far too risky to make it worth doing.

It's similar to playing the roulette wheel at vegas. If it lands on red or black, you win 1.05x your money. If it lands on green, a pair of men will drag you into the back alley and shoot you in the head. Would you play that table? Of course not, the potential upside is nice but the downside of the admittedly long odds failure completely offset any winnings you might get. 

So yes, it's maybe 1-5% that if it falls, it falls on a person. And a .01% chance that it's going to fall period. So yes, it's unlikely BUT there's still a lot of reason not to even take the chance to begin with, this is the stuff that makes people want to ban drones.
justamomento, Strong words from someone who talks about getting naked to communicate with aliens and posted ["what camera is best for up skirt shots"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/6g1jn5/best_camera_for_upskirts/) Dafuck dude.
lispychicken, Oh good lord! It doesnt seem that long from the top :/
Vipre7, Hahaha no I don't work for Royal Caribbean, I'm speaking from personal experience, the experience of friends and neighbors, and the reviews that you can find online. 
ablack82, I'm still in Grand Cayman so no crying from me 
ablack82, Ya that's kinda what I figured! I have a few more pictures and some videos if you're interested! And if you use that overhead shot in a marketing piece I want credit!! Haha
thecentury, If he doesn't have his 107.... Paying him could get him in trouble!
Toughest_Mouse, He could be out in sea and not in the boundaries of a country and thus not constrained by max alt laws. For the MAX ALT limit on your Mavic Pro it's in the settings where you can change that. Just move the slider to the left to lower it or to the right to raise it. 
ablack82, There is a way to change it in the settings I'm sure a google search would show you. It's been a while since I changed mine so the process has changed I think. It is pretty difficult to go higher than 500m (1640 feet) with out hacking into the settings, but there is a way to increase max altitude to 500m. 
HopeHeisOk, I have a yuneec q500 4K and you can plug into the bird and change the settings using the GUI 
goodDayM, > sample the white or black to color correct

What does that mean exactly? Like in Lightroom what steps would one take to do that?
ablack82,  Still have all the RAW images that I might play with later 
ablack82, Nope I flew here, customs opened it up and looked at it but they had no issues with it. Everyone has been friendly and I haven't had trouble with any people telling me not to fly. 
drwuzer, Dramatic - yes - Stating that a 2 pound drone could could "literally **kill** **multiple** people when it falls" is pretty fucking dramatic and alarmist.    A better, less dramatic, and more accurate way of stating this might be "it could potentially hurt someone if it falls"  Especially when you won't find a single instance of a drone this size EVER, killing ANYONE.   It's alarmist bullshit like this that causes irrational fear in the public, and unwarranted, overreaching laws getting enacted by cowardly, moronic, politicians. 
None, [deleted]
-webkit, I landed my phantom 3 after clipping a redwood like 100' up and busting off half of 2 rotors. I had to instantly flip it to manual though because the sensors flipped out.
ablack82, Why fly planes, why drive cars, why swim??? There is a chance of someone getting injured with pretty much anything you do.
None, [deleted]
ablack82, I hear that all the time. 
Supes_man, Suuuuuuuuuuuuuure. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
vinnybankroll, Haha of course. I'm in australia and glory doesn't sail here so that won't be happening from my end, but I would otherwise.
gurgle528, If he was in the Cayman Islands when he took the picture US law does not apply because it's a British territory. He also said somewhere else has 900' in the air. 
ablack82, Omg no!!!!!! 
ablack82, I'm in the Cayman Islands where the FAA regulations do not matter 
LionWaffles, Ahh ok, thanks for the help
LionWaffles, Cool
Supes_man, And I could EASILY counter that stupid and needlessly risky behavior like this is why the public hates drone users. Even though most of us take the time to do things safely and legally, we're not the ones who get the public attention. It's idiots who fly directly above people, swoop in low over crowds, trespass on private property, get to close to airports, that's FAR more of a big deal than the drone community coming down on a user for doing something unsafe.

This was a risky and illegal maneuver here in the United States being directly above a crowd like that. Doesn't matter if it's 10 feet up for 400, it's just wreckless behavior. If my phrasing upsets you then man, I don't know how to help.
Supes_man, Exactly. That was the essence of the post.

>cmon man don't fuck this up for the rest of us




Casban, Okay color me impressed! I didn't know it was possible.
Supes_man, You're severely missing the point dude.

Planes are restricted to certain altitudes and flight paths. If you deviate from them too much you can be massively fined, imprisoned, or even shot down. 

Cars must stay on very defined roads and in lane that are barely two feet wider than the car itself. They must stop at lights, not exceed speed limits, only go a certain direction, I could type up a post all afternoon about the regulations on cars.

Swimming, that doesn't apply. If you drown then that's your own tough cookies. If you screw up swimming you're not going to damage property, injure, or kill someone else.

I'm one of the LAST people to advocate for more government, rules, and laws. We have far too many as it is. But it only takes a few idiots doing stupid things like flying over crowds and for it to happen 1 or 2 times before a massive public outcry will severly impact the entire drone community. So absolutely yes I will call out someone who is endangering something I make part of my living off of.
ablack82, You're a fucking creep 
SilentGuardian3, This guy fucks
Vipre7, Well according to http://travel.usnews.com/cruises/best-cruise-lines-for-the-money/

for best cruise lines for the money, Celebrity is #1, Royal Caribbean is #2, Norweigan is #3, and Carnival is #4. 

All I can say is don't believe me or anyone on the internet until you've tried it yourself. The service, dining, entertainment, is all better on Royal Caribbean and Celebrity kicks it up another notch. Usually, Carnival is cheaper, but to make a vacation go from great to amazing I'm OK spending a few hundred extra. I'm a Diamond member now so I get free unlimited drinks included. I don't drink tho, so I just drink like 5 strawberry smoothies instead of 5 glasses of champagne :D 
ablack82, Well pass that picture along and toss me a few hundred if they use it hahah
Stevejhgla, True, but what you did *is* illegal under [Cayman Islands Civil Aviation Authority regulations](https://www.caacayman.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/CAA_Drones_Flyer.pdf)...assuming you didn't apply for the appropriate permissions that is. :)
drwuzer, There are ways to emphasize safety, without feeding into the public's grossly misinformed hysteria about drones.  Claiming that a drone could "literally kill multiple people" absolutely feeds that hysteria.  

"Anonymous sources state that these drones are capable of killing multiple people if they crash"  -  CNN
ablack82, Good thing I'm not in the United States. 
airman123456, I do not have a link, but I remember a YouTube video where someone did a Phantom (maybe Mavric) torture test where they cut the props. It blew my mind. You could probably find it with a simple YouTube search. 
pmow, OP's arguments aside, I like the driving analogy because you risk others' lives.

Drivers who speed do not get 'yelled' at in person or on Reddit, even though it's illegal and can cause accidents and people to die.

On the other hand, driving is necessary while flying drones is simply not. Perhaps this should be why public shaming is acceptable.  We want to establish sane done laws around the world for everyone to enjoy the craft.

I don't disagree that it is tactically a bad idea. But is it wrong?
ablack82, So since you make part of your living off of I assume you are abiding by all of the FAA regulations? Even if you sell a picture to a friend you are supposed to register your flight plan with the FAA before hand. 
Supes_man, On this, you and I are in full agreement.
Supes_man, You literally sound like something from r/fellowkids trying to pass off as a normal user when in fact you're like the vp of sales.
vinnybankroll, 👍
ablack82, Good thing I'm back in the states and we don't extradite prisoners to the Cayman Islands 
Supes_man, Good thing that's not what happened here. You're missing the forest for the trees, any logical person can see this was a nicely put heads up warning and the drone community looking out for itself. 

Nothing "hysteria" inducing about it unless you are actively looking to frame it that way. 
Supes_man, So you completely ignore the fact that I destroyed your argument and try to start new stuff? Good grief dude.
Vipre7, LOL. If it makes you feel better I'll delete all my comments. I thought the internet, especially reddit, was a safe place to speak your mind and share opinions. 

I simply said my opinion and shared a link that anyone can find with a google search. Look at Consumer Reports. Even yelp.com has a higher rating for Celebrity and Royal Caribbean than Carnival. 

Why are you drilling me down for simply sharing basic stuff? 

Tell you what, since you think I'm a VP of Sales at Royal Caribbean, I would like to extend this opportunity and invite you to not go on a cruise with us, but rather book a cruise with Carnival. You may love it, you may not. Just let me know if you do and your experience my friend.
Stevejhgla, The Treaty on Extradition between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed in 1972 says otherwise.  You're going down bud!
ablack82, I since you are all about regulations and rules, I want to make sure that you have never broken any of them?
ablack82, It was a joke haha if the Cayman authorities want to talk to me I'll be glad to listen


Snvw, I'm so glad, Thy Art is our saviour.
ZHiiFt, I can't picture me CJ sing clean tbh
awellplacedkick, Thank fuck
Jamal_x, "I'll take 'Let's do the exact opposite of SS and restore faith in deathcore' for 600, Alex."
actuallyaheron, I'm 100% okay with this

EchoInTheRoom, Our elders have [not] failed us!
Rielglowballelleit, I mean... Ofcourse not. 
None, I think CJ couldn't even sing properly. And also why is this even up for debate?
SidDefinition, But will we still get a acoustic of whore to a chainsaw?
RadiationOverdose, Good, I can't stand clean vocals.
Suicidal-Ghost666, That's good to know they aren't going to be using cleans but I hope CJ is open to not only using mids on the next album. 
AlienatedLabor, Unfortunate tbh

CheekyJester, Did you have a stroke while typing that lmao
Bang-Bang-Wang, Teehee?
BagofSocks, I personally think CJ could pull off the 'teehee' from Doris quite well. 

/s
CheekyJester, Grasping here, but is that a reference to Thy Art's song 'Violent Reckoning'?
DirtySanchezPlatypus, Well I think most people would've said the same thing about Suicide Silence, and look how that turned out. 
None, I'm pretty sure he sung in school when he was younger and apparently he's not a bad singer. But thank fuck TAIM know to keep Teehees out of deathcore.
Jamal_x, Interviewer for the article asked about their thoughts on the direction Suicide Silence was headed; brought up clean vocals. 
yodels_for_twinkies, eeeeradicationnn of them alllll, whoooooooore to a chainsawww
SeverTheKing, I love some good cleans, but definitely not in deathcore.
ZHiiFt, I'm foreign dude, I'm allowed to type wrong.
napalmlungs, Wait, what? I havent actually bothered lisening to Doris cause the band has been fucking awful since NTTB... He says teehee? 
None, Yeah but I'm pretty sure the lyrics is "Our allies have failed us" but idk, I might be wrong.
Rielglowballelleit, True
deadmanRise, I'm out of the loop, SS is using cleans now?
None, Oh, thats interesting. Thanks for bringing this up!
nohitter21, You don't like new Fit For an Autopsy?
None, This. Cleans are fine, but they don't blend with the deathcore sound at all. Jonny Craig fan till I die, but keep it out of deathcore ffs.
CheekyJester, I dunno why, but I always thought you were Scottish, who - come to think of it - pretty much do speak a separate language.
Sebtecha, The first clean vocal sound on the track is somewhere between a weak Michael Jackson "HEEHEE" and a fat, balding, out of breath man going "teehee".
Matt08642, I really just listened to Suicide Silence's back catalog, but do people really dislike NTTB and The Black Crown?
CheekyJester, It's actually "Our leaders have failed us".
Did-you-reboot, Oh man, I'm so sorry you had to hear it this way.

DirtySanchezPlatypus, I wish I could have remained oblivious and happy. 
None, You're still innocent. If you are offered any links, remember to scream "FIRE", run away, and find the nearest adult.
nohitter21, Don't even bother listening or looking up the drama. It'll just retroactively ruin the band for you :(
ryanricardfth, doesn't even sound like singing, i dunno where people are getting this singing rumours from, its just some big effect on some yells
blues4thecup, Too bad Johnny Craig is a fucking asshole IRL
ZHiiFt, Why scottish? haha.


Anyhow, nah I'm norweigan my dude.
napalmlungs, I sure do! Haha
None, Oh fuck that's true I remember from when I used to practice vocals to that song.
EchoInTheRoom, Ayyyy this guy! <3
deadmanRise, That was... worse than I expected. 
Lasereye, Ew why
necrosteve028, HAHA All Shall Perish responded to me saying Eddie is doing that as a stylistic choice to show his range (after I said I don't think he can come back and scream like he used to for ASP) then I hear this. I seriously don't want him back at ASP.
Rosie2jz, I just put Green Monster on and rock back and forth until i forget about that abomination doris
nohitter21, I tried sending the link but it keeps telling me there's an error so go to 2:15 in Heads Will Hang and tell me he isn't singing.
CheekyJester, Awesome! :D My Norwegian friend streams, and whenever he speaks Norwegian, everyone in the chat spams "Demon language!"
Matt08642, Dang so it's one of those "TRVVVVE HXC FANS ONLY LIKE THEIR EP AND 1ST ALBUM" bands...
CheekyJester, <3
Ranteh, Like it's not even good cleans

It's all around bad
ryanricardfth, wtf is that they have a good song going then just stop for a good minute for some spoken word shit
napalmlungs, Uh... No? I just really do not like anything theyve made after their first two major releases... Holy fuck people in this sub are idiots. 
nohitter21, Sounds amazing to me so i don't care
Matt08642, > Holy fuck people in this sub are idiots

What makes you say that? It just came off that way from how you described it.

>first two major releases

So you do like NTTB? or do you count their EP as a major release?
ryanricardfth, i only just started listening to that band ugh, i come here for deathcore not whatever the fuck you call that crap
napalmlungs, ...the cleansing is a full length released on century media...
nohitter21, That's still deathcore lol doesn't matter if you don't like it
Matt08642, > I just really do not like anything theyve made after their first two major releases

their first two releases were The Cleansing and NTTB, and then you said you didn't like NTTB?

So are you counting their 2005 EP as a major release or what?

I'm just trying to figure out where people started disliking this band lmao
ryanricardfth, clean singing is not deathcore, come on man don't be stupid
napalmlungs, You mentioned black crown in your comment
None, So Shadow Of Intent aren't deathcore? They have clean singing in a song.
CheekyJester, I see what you're trying to say, but a song / band can definitely still be Deathcore, while using clean vocals. However, once a band has clean singing on almost every song, (or the clean singing is almost / more prominent than the unclean vocals:) then it is likely no longer Deathcore, and more akin to Metalcore. I never understood why people consider Slice the Cake Deathcore. They're amazing, but not straight Deathcore. An example of Deathcore with clean singing would be 'The Twin Revelation' by Shadow of Intent. There is quite a bit of clean singing, but it is undeniably still Deathcore.
Matt08642, Alright so the confusion comes from me saying "do people hate NTTB and TBC?"

You said yes, and then I assumed you meant you hated both NTTB and TBC, where you only actually hated TBC.

Cleared up now lol.

Anyway, yeah this new SS album sucks mad dick
ryanricardfth, i'm not having this argument again, clean singing is not fucking deathcore and never will be end of story
ryanricardfth, no they can't, you are so fucking stupid, like really how can you be this fucking dumb, none of the bands who started deathcore used cleans you can't pick some new age band and say thats deathcore when they never where around during the start, carnifex, i declare war, the red shorem hiroshima will burn, as blood runs black, oceano, despised icon all real deathcore bands who started this movement and they never used any clean fucking singing cuz its not apart of deathcore FFS do your research children you look dumb as fuck
None, Didn't realize your opinion is a fact lol.
CheekyJester, You are 100% trolling. Nice bait fam. Also: As Blood Runs Black used cleans lmao
ryanricardfth, no you people are too dumb to realize what deathcore is, and that singing has been and never will be a part of deathcore, they have metalcore for a reason do some fucking research its not that hard
None, [removed]
None, Dude calm down, clean vocals can work in deathcore if done right, and if a band wants to take that direction they still can. New Suicide Silence fucking sucked, but listen to the song "The Twin Revelation" by Shadow Of Intent, it's a good example of clean vocals making sense in a deathcore context. Pretty much one of the only good examples of it though. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_luGmLPDS8
None, [removed]
CheekyJester, Mate, you PM'ed me, calling me a cunt lmao. Get off your high horse, ye gronk.
flixdaking, This is the guy who abuses ad hominem in every single of his replies, and said Slice The Cake are a shit band. Don't bother.
ryanricardfth, do you realize you are a dick head and i dont give a fuck about your dumb ass wrong opinion 
None, Thanks for the heads up lol
nohitter21, LOL alright bud
flixdaking, People like him piss me off. The genre has been around of years but of course he knows better than everyone else because he's some sort of omniscient god of knowledge.
ryanricardfth, so its settled deathcore = no fucking girly clean singing
metalcore = clean singing
quit being an ignorant fuck and get with the times
None, Also he's closed minded af
nohitter21, This is a lost cause so I'm not arguing, whatever man, keep listening to trve kvlt music only.

TurnDownForTendies, This is jaw dropping. I saw your name and was wondering why you were screwing around with an atx power supply. Then the further I scrolled down the more my jaw dropped.

Some of the stuff here is so compact I can't even tell what's going on. I didn't even known a dedicated gpu could connect to a stx board.

Seriously, props man.
vinipc, Wow. This is REALLY impressive. Congratulations!

(I'm new here. Haven't seen any of your previous mantions of this build)

And here I was, thinking my Elite 110 was gonna be a small pc.
Suluco, I've mentioned this build a few times, but now it's finally complete!
Wolf_LikeMe, I'm not entirely sure what exactly is going on here but I'm a fan of your work. It's left me lost for words.
RainbowWizardLizard, So how do I get my hands on this 
alystair, You can't fool me this is clearly a [hard drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbkernCk2Yk)!

Seriously tho', fantastic project. Can you provide more information about the PSU brick? I'd want to make an SFF project without the wall wart.
ExodusC, Have you thought about throwing a black powdercoat on it? 

Do you do these simply for your own satisfaction or do you ever sell them? 
MathiazsLindberg, Looks amazing, kinda sucks that some things are cheaper because they're smaller, while some things are crazy expensive because they're smaller. Paying more for less, without getting higher quality, just irritates me :(
kofapox, AMAZING, any throttling on the GPU on load? the HDPLEX can handle the 1060 and the i5 at load when gaming? impressive, how much liters is that?
Ca11idus, Now just paint it black, add a small circular emblem in the middle of the gpu fan side and add some psu stickers and you'll have the look down. Lol, have friends come over and ask you if that is a 1500 watt psu or something and you tell em it's a fully functioning computer.

Glad you saw this project through. I'm impressed.
Dominathan, I honestly thought this was just a power supply.... Damn dude.  This is amazing.  Love how you used the M.2 for the PCI-E
Lebelzunce, Impressive work! I think we might need a vSFF category for this :)
curiositie, Y'all finished it!
None, [deleted]
gautamb0, Great to see it done, really fantastic work. This showcases just how tiny things can get when pushed to the limits.
harbichidian, That's all that is inside my SSDs!? Why don't they make half length versions for machines with limited slots?
None, [deleted]
__Kaari__, Oh gewd, that's genius :O
Congratz!
Noxime, Holy crap, this is awesome! For a second I was so puzzled how you got a GPU connected :/

Do you think it would be in any way possible to have a 1070 mini and a 7700k in there? You would probably need an external powerbrick... 

meepsi, Did you desolder and remove the mobo's VGA port?
cd109876, Is the gpu bottlenecked by the M.2 connector?
blrPepper, That's impressive !

I assume you used a pico PSU of some sort (I really don't know much about that), does it require an external power brick ?

kofapox, Another question, you are using the other M2 slot, for a wifi card, right?
wildtallywacker, Holy hell. One look and I thought it had to be a PSU.

And then bam, it's a full PC with a 1060 loaded into it. Color me impressed!
Aleblanco1987, Un fucking believable
hobitopia, I saw your comment about that adapter and found [this rather quickly.](https://www.amazon.com/M-2-NGFF-PCI-e-Express-Adapter/dp/B01I2WVFLU/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1491566274&sr=8-10&keywords=m.2+to+pcie+adapter)

Not expensive and seeming available, just in case anyone was trying to replicate this!
velociraptawwr, That looks amazing. Really impressive.

Forgive my ignorance, but how powerful is it in the end? Do you actually use it regularly? Do you have any benchmarks? I'm not an expert in SFFPCs and I just can't wrap my head around how small this is.
marcelo161193, I love this project and i want to build mine but i'm not sure about this chipset....Is it any good? It would be perfect if had a z270 stx in the market..
Suluco, Thanks!

Let me know if you have any questions about aspects of the build, I glossed over a lot of the details in this album.

Yup, the proliferation of M.2 PCIe SSDs is awesome because now these small boards have these x4 PCIe slots exposed and with the right adapter they can be used for all sorts of neat projects they weren't intended for.

It's very much "do at your own risk" though, usually it can work since it's just PCI Express, but there's no guarantees. And it's also very important to use a powered riser, M.2 slots obviously aren't designed to provide 75W of power through it like the video card expects from the slot.
Suluco, The Elite 110 isn't terrible, but it's mass-produced so it can't make the crazy tradeoffs like this to radically reduce the size.
Suluco, Haha, I guess it's not super clear what exactly this is.

Basically this is a full gaming computer inside a custom case the size of a long ATX power supply.
Suluco, I may be selling this unit mostly as it is (but with a few caveats) and I have a second bare chassis.

PM me if you're interested.
Suluco, The power solution used here are from HDPLEX: http://www.hd-plex.com/HDPLEX-NanoATX-Power-Supply-Combo-Solution

Let me know if you have any particular questions.
Suluco, I thought about but decided to go with bare aluminum for that cheap OEM look.

This particular project was to prove a point. I think ATX power supplies are overly big for today's hardware, because now you can fit an entire gaming computer inside one.
Suluco, If you're referring to the BPlus P4SM2 adapter I really don't know what's up with that. I bought mine for around $55, which is steep, but from my research it's the most reliable of the M.2 to PCIe x4 adapters so I felt it was reasonable.

But now it's only available direct for $125. I'm not sure whether that's because they're purposely price gouging or they're short on stock.
Suluco, The GPU is fine since it has dedicated intake.

The DC-ATX is a bit underspecced, it's capable of more than 160W. The AC-DC is the weak link here, and an i5 6400T and GTX 1060 is right on the edge of tripping OCP for it.

I specifically wanted the GTX 1060 to show what's possible and push the envelope, but I'd recommend a GTX 1050 Ti or something with equivalent power draw for long-term use in a build like this so the AC-DC isn't running right up to its limits under load.

The upcoming 300W HPDLEX AC-DC might fit, but it'd require either a different Mini-STX motherboard that has a internal power header, or removing the DC jack and soldering wires to it to get rid of the bulk angled DC connector it currently requires.

And it require some extreme cable management since the 300W would then fill up the gap between the motherboard and AC-DC that's currently being used for wire stuffing.
Suluco, Oh forgot to answer your other question, it's 3.0L.
Suluco, Thanks!
Suluco, Yup, just a bit behind schedule :p
Suluco, The HDPLEX 160W DC-ATX has been proven to run even a GTX 1070, though it requires cooling: https://smallformfactor.net/forum/threads/has-anyone-used-24-pin-hdplex-160w-pico-style.1454/page-2#post-30653

The HDPLEX 160W AC-DC internal brick though is not capable of much more than what it's rated for without tripping OCP. Which is why I stuck with the 35W TDP 6400T instead of something beefier for the CPU.
Suluco, I've been complaining for a while now that ATX PSUs are stupidly big and SFX-L should be the standard.

So that's part of why I did this, to demonstrate that the ATX form factor is big enough to fit an entire computer inside of, and not just some web browsing piece of junk, but a competent gaming rig.
Suluco, Because then the screw holes wouldn't line up on the drive mounts.

Unfortunately getting the PCB out involved tearing through the sticker so it voids the warranty.
Suluco, What do you mean?
Suluco, Possibly, the main limitation of the current setup is the 160W AC-DC.

It'll be difficult, but it may be possible to fit the upcoming HDPLEX 300W AC-DC, so with either that or an external high-wattage brick, the only other limitations are space and heat.

A 7700K would probably run pretty hot in there, but should just avoid thermal throttling if ambient temps aren't too high and maybe 40mm fans are installed at the rear space permitting.
Suluco, No, I haven't made any permanent modifications to motherboard.
Suluco, A little but not by much since it runs at 3.0 x4: https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GeForce_GTX_1080_PCI_Express_Scaling/
Suluco, It uses a HDPLEX 160W AC-DC and 160W DC-ATX.

None of the picoPSUs would work because the only internal brick that would fit is 19V and the wide input Pico is not powerful enough.
Suluco, Yes. I'm not sure if the H110M-STX comes with that card, but this board originally came out of the DeskMini 110 barebones kit so I used the card and antennas that came with that.
Suluco, Thanks!
Suluco, Someone chimed in on the forum thread about that adapter and they could only get it to run at x2. And from looking at the pics, it looks like only half the pins are wired up to the slot.
Suluco, I haven't used it at all. I wrapped this project up right before my trip overseas and I just got back.
TurnDownForTendies, I noticed that riser cable's pcie connector doesn't match the x4 pcie slot. Has that had any effect on the gpu's performance? At the very least I can see that the card displays an image but I'm surprised that anything shows up at all since all of the connectors aren't met.
vinipc, Yeah, I know. I just hand never imagined how small you could get with custom cases. Just a question... how much technical knowledge do you need to do this kind of stuff?
Wolf_LikeMe, It's awesome. Congrats
laecheln, How much would you sell something like this? Rough figure? 
ExodusC, Agreed- I was astounded when I measured the power draw of my entire gaming rig under full load, the most I could possibly stress the hardware... And it was pulling around 250 watts.

Pretty incredible how far we've come in terms of power draw. 
curiositie, I'd been *very* casually following this on sffn, and last I saw I think you and Aibohphobia were discussing who was going to finish it or something?

Regardless, it looks great, I'm glad you got it done! Truly impressive.

cd109876, Ok, that's interesting.
hobitopia, Interesting, that's unfortunate then. 
velociraptawwr, Okay, any plans with it? I'd love to see it in action.
Suluco, The M.2 slot is only capable of PCIe 3.0 x4.

I'm using a x16 to x16 extender because this one met my flexibility, reliability, fitment, and length requirements, but if a suitable x4 to x16 exists I could use that as well.

As far as the GPU, it's not really any different than using it in a slot that's physically x16 but electrically only x8 or even x4 on a normal motherboard. It's not ideal, but TechPowerUp and others have demonstrated that even PCIe 3.0 x4 doesn't bottleneck the card that much in most circumstances.
Suluco, The full build log for this doubles as a "How to design a sheet metal case" guide: https://smallformfactor.net/forum/threads/stx160-0-the-most-powerful-atx-unit-in-the-world.934/

It's not for the faint of heart, but it's entirely doable even with no real background in design or engineering if you put in the time and effort.

I've been at this stuff for awhile now, but I have no formal training in any of this and had to start from scratch like anyone else.
Suluco, Ah, I am Aibohphobia.

I was going to just dump the project on whoever wanted to pick up where I left off, but I decided to hunker down and finish it.
Suluco, No, I'll be selling it because I gifted the video card to someone and I never really had a need for this to begin with.

I think ATX is stupidly big so this was just to prove a point.
curiositie, Aha, hey there. :P

Good job getting down to it, then!
velociraptawwr, Oh okay, 
well — point proved. Looking forward to seeing more work from you in the future.
Suluco, Yeah, I have some ideas for another "PC in a PSU" thing that would one up this but it probably won't happen for some time.

MikeNizzle82, Nice job. This is beautiful design and fabrication. 
rckbrn, What are the desk mounted switches you refer to? Power and reset? 
warmaster, Could you please share the cad files?
dlittlefair1, Yeah sure, it’ll be tomorrow or maybe later on tonight if I get back home early. What are you planning with them? 
U99vMagog, How did you smoothen out the 3D printed parts? Paint and some kind of filler?
firstaccountieverhad, Amazing case. I'm always astounded when people build computer cases themselves and especially when the end up with such a nice finish.

What are you temps like on the graphics card? With the fans facing the glass is it difficult for it to keep cool?

dlittlefair1, Well that’s why I put 2 fans pushing the air outward on the front, so that when the graphics card pushes air into the case, the front fans are drawing air out too!
FarazR2, Maybe it's just how the build shines, but it kind of reminds me of tubes, and kind of reminds me of a shiny toaster. Really cool retro aesthetic
KyleWolf56, How did you find that curved glass, or is it acrylic, either way, do you purchase it like that? 
Fatigue-Error, Amazing work.  That's a piece of art!
flekinjo, Can you tell how you got sanded (brushed) effect on that transparent acrylic?
dlittlefair1, Which process? The bending?
dlittlefair1, Sanding would have ended up with a brushed effect, so either sand blasting or lacquer was the option!
LostSiD, Amazing build dude. This would be an ideal size for what I want my own custom build to be or just about. If you could send me a PM when you put the whole process thread up I would really appreciate it! Will PM you also!
None, [deleted]
dlittlefair1, Just power, so that my lazy ass can sit in a bean bag and use barely any energy to turn it on 😂
dlittlefair1, Good bit of sanding to get rid of the build marks, then built primer up nice and thick as it’s easier to sand that. Then got Matt vinyl paint which seemed very forgiving when it came to the final coat, then just a coating of Matt lacquer!
dlittlefair1, I’ve just been playing rise of the tomb raider and the temps are slightly lower than my off the shelf PC case I had prior, I suspect it’s because the gpu is now mounted properly, and the fans at the front are drawing air out.
dlittlefair1, I had a 3D model in solidworks white allows you to flatten it out for laser cutting, then sent it to somewhere near me for bending
dlittlefair1, It’s shown on the last few pics when I mask it but I forgot to show the spray paint! It’s just Matt lacquer! Same one I used on the front panel.
dlittlefair1, Matt lacquer, masked the other area to keep it gloss.
rckbrn, Haha! You should make it wireless. Maybe you can also add some gesture control where things trigger by waving your hand above the clear plastic.

Looking good! 
ccricers, The capacitive switch is nice. It stands out a lot from other power switches of scratch built cases.
brando93, Who's Matt Lacquer? 
twigboy, Ahh was wondering how you got that professional looking finish!

Not usually one to want glass, but that is such a nice case
KyleWolf56, what would that process be called? Likely something that needs to be done out of house?
thanks for quick reply btw
None, [deleted]
flekinjo, Thanks for the info, never would have occured to me. I though you might have sanded it, but this sound like a lot more elegant solution. 
dlittlefair1, He’s the smoothest guy in town.
dlittlefair1, I modelled as much as I could and found some on grabcad. I’ll likely share the whole assembly at some point. Send me a PM so I know who you’re interested.
brando93, Half brother of Matt Vinyl, of course he'd be smooth 
dlittlefair1, Son of Matt Paint, though he’s a bit of a drip.
