DarthOzai: 43 : Please keep this shit out of this subreddit

xtremechaos: 96 : Top- of the frontpage.

I'd say the rest of reddit gave this comment a resounding "fuck you" lol

clumsygirllovescats: 50 : *Everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked*

ExtreemWeenie: 20 : it will be over soon

tomdizzo: 97 : stop being a little bitch. Like this subreddit gets tons of traction it will be over in a minute.

akakiran: 148 : Lol I thought I was clicking on the black people twitter. Its been a while since I visited this subreddit though so kind of cool that it was on here

None: 45 : Sure, what do you want to talk about instead?

emptyzombiekilla: 12 : The formuoli

MrTittyFingers: 18 : I mean, it's funny

ymmilitia: 160 : Why? It's funny. I'm sure it's against the subreddit rules, but I'm certain if this got posted in other subs it would be not recieved as well as it would here. 

JrSan1011: 40 : It's hilarious and have a sense of humor

mylifewithya: 4 : True

ArielScync: 119 : I laughed out loud, tho. Then again I'm not American, so it's easy to laugh when it's not my country that's collapsing.

apintandafight: 105 : Actually we are rather used to clowns in the White House, I think it will be business as usual tomorrow. 

GiverOfTheKarma: 84 : If we survived Nixon, we can survive any ass-hat the two-party system throws at us. 

theValeofErin: 38 : Yeah, but look at where W. got us. . .

Cashew_Biscuit: 114 : As a non american the whole of reddit is pretty shit today. So difficult to avoid political bs in every subreddit.

GigantoMungus: 10 : Poor baby.

RosesAndThyme: 49 : It is both appropriate, and timely, therefore no.

winksup: 167 : It's only appropriate to those that want Obama to continue being president....so saying it's appropriate is extremely subjective.  You got the timely part down though.

envyxd: 97 : Obviously the voters have decided. 

We are a democracy or something right? Especially on reddit?

runujhkj: 82 : His approval's record high, most people prefer him to either of the replacements. 

rayquazarocker: 16 : It's a weak meme

Blonde_Calculator: 109 : No everyone is American.

Not every American is Obama supporter.

Not every Obama supporter voted for Hilary.

None: 71 : Really? A sub as specific as this has to devolve into politics as well?

None: 64 : He means all political shit not just democratic, but yes I agree

SillyAmerican3: 50 : Completely agree, how did this even climb so fast?

donottakethisserious: 3 : CTR

Omnilatent: 61 : It's kinda funny and relevant to the outcome of the election.

Palin_Sees_Russia: 98 : Because it's fucking Election Day??? If it was any other day, your question would have been valid.

JackRayleigh: 42 : It's on /r/all now it's getting huge votes

mylifewithya: 6 : ‚úåüèΩÔ∏è‚úåüèΩÔ∏è

None: 81 : If I post this while it's already popular nobody will see I was a Zutara shipper.

Jacob_Mango: 22 : He is a Zutara Shipper

NorthBlizzard: 168 : The circlejerk. At least one thing is for certain, no matter who is elected, reddit will finally go back to criticizing and blaming the president for everything again. 

imapotato99: 74 : and they actually do very little compared to local and state politicians
