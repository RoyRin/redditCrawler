Urban Bonsai Tree - Chinese Pepper tree in an urban setting. Broken and graffitied fence topped with barbed wire, empty cider cans strewn on the paving slabs, tagged postbox and miniature street sign denoting the species. Combining my two favourite things - bonsai and street art.

Alright, I've had enough of this. I want to work on the Mi A1 but it's not possible because they haven't released the Kernel sources. @xiaomi @XiaomiUSA you're violating the GPLv2 license of the Linux Kernel by not release the Kernel sources for your @androidone device.

DarkRedHeadphone,Do you know what chinese companies care about more than anything else ? User public opinion, go on amazon, aliexpress, everywhere where you can find there products and give them one star. We will obtain the Kernel source in a few days. #respectGPLv2

houston_wehaveaprblm,What's the use of kernel sources
Noob here
sharkcpn,Kernel sources are building blocks of operating system. Think of them as ingredients using which you can cook custom ROMs and custom kernels.
EDDIE_BR0CK,I've always viewed the kernel as the interface between Software (Android) and Hardware (SoC, USB, etc).
omniuni,Sources do two things. First, it means easier development of alternate firmware. Second, it helps support development on similar devices.

nybreath,I am sorry to say that is no fresh news from Xiaomi, I remember developers saying the same for almost every phone they released.  
They just release the sources really late, it is unfair, it is also a good things that developers whine about it, but it will hardly change anything.

teqnor,I get it that they are required to release these but why even support them with buying their phone? Buy an brand that follow the guidelines on the open source...

Are their phones that great?
AchaMahide,For the quality, they pretty much the cheapest.

Especially here in South East Asia, people are buying them like peanuts. I know one local company that gives out 2 Xiaomi phones to employees for operational purposes, with the policy of "throw them out if/ when they broke"
teqnor,Ok they arent that big here in Sweden.

What do they have to loose in releasing the sources? 
AchaMahide,Im guessing other chinese company as competitors, since their MIUI is a pretty popular selling point?

But honestly I'm straight up guessing here.
I_JUST_LIVE_HERE_OK,> Im guessing other chinese company as competitors, since their MIUI is a pretty popular selling point?

They have to release kernel sources, not MIUI sources. While the kernel is responsible for everything important (resource allocation, memory management, task scheduling, etc), it's invisible to end users.

Chinese competitors could copy Xiaomi's kernel to their devices (if it even booted, which it wouldn't), but end users wouldn't notice anything.
AchaMahide,ah, I see.
BenjaminGeiger,I have a Mi Pad 3, and while the hardware is great, MIUI sucks pretty hard. I'd kill to have AOSP on it.
AchaMahide,From what I can gather, hardware is appealing to the more techie crowd, while MIUI to the more casual users.

In my office (where 80% uses Xiaomi phones) you can pretty much hear people talk about MIUI features, such as the second space thing, and themes, they looove themes.

Malynde,As if a chinese company would give a single fuck about this guys opinion...the phone sells without released kernel since nobody give a shit about it and world moves on.
choikwa,But they will give fucks about court barring them from selling to US market
flounder0049,Is there legal ground to stand on that could get an injunction against selling the device in the US, and perhaps in other countries that respect/uphold the GPL? Seems like that might get their attention pretty quick.
antiquegeek,yes but have fun funding that lawsuit. The FSF might play ball if they had enough leverage and proof.
iMangeshSN,True. Only drop in an ocean would care. 
fudge_u,You're probably right, but Franco is probably one of the best kernel developers around.  I remember using his kernels on my Galaxy Nexus phone back in the day.
octa_core,That's why people who value open source code and customization should never buy from those Chinese brands that only care about non tech people. Not gonna mention brand names, but most of those, with the cloned iphone ui roms inside don't give a shit about xda. I know this is android one phone we are talking about here, but xiaomi stays xiaomi.
fudge_u,Franco does kernel development for the OnePlus phones.  AFAIK, he hasn't run into any issues with their phones.  BTW, they're a Chinese company.
octa_core,Yup, correct. And one of the reasons I have considered purchasing OnePlus 5t has been their positive attitude towards custom kernels and custom roms. That has been historically the trend with one plus. However, lets not compare OP to xiaomi. The whole big deal about one plus was that it was geared towards enthusiasts. Xiaomi has never even claimed to support enthusiasts.
victorvscn,I agree that you can vote with your wallet but this is an outright violation of the license. We can't shift the blame here, nor can we shift the attention from **their** mistake.

GoodOcycak,This is problem I have with XiaoMi, their phones are great value, they started the bezelless trend, which I love, but there is one problem I have with them. SOFTWARE. I am using Xiaomi as my daily driver, but I really hate how miui manages ram. Also I had one situation that I wiped all data through recovery, and after I did the setup, I had to type password, but there was a "problem with servers" and I couldn't.  The solution was to delete my mi account and create a new one which is bullshit in my opinion. Also a problem with their software is, as mentioned here, their license policy...
DravensMoustache,Flash your rom to epic rom, they manage the hardware WAY better (if you have one of the compatible phones)

Or just use LineageOs.

BurgerUSA,It takes them 6 months to 1 year to release the source. Also tell the same to Samsung and Huawei if you have balls. lmao
m-p-3,Although bigger, they're not GPL-compliant and Xiaomi being smaller has the opportunity to show some leadership and integrity towards those giants.

Also, they still aren't GPL-compliant, as the source has to be available for each kernel releases, not only the ones they wish to publish.
benjimaestro,Whataboutism is pointless. Samsung do release sources, and I'm pretty sure Huawei do via openkirin.

This is /r/Xiaomi, don't expect Samsung or Huawei kernel source posts here because they're irrelevant - this post is relevant to the sub, and looking at the traction it's gaining, it could have an effect.
Trashcanbin13,If I were Xiaomi decision maker I wouldn't give this sub a damn to be very honest. A1 is selling well even without custom kernel - it's a fine, affordable piece of phone that finally is worthy to be called as a replacement of my Nexus 5.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for releasing kernel in a timely manner, but reddit has no power whatsoever other than rallying public support for a cause.
itzkold,samsung has a form on their website that you can fill out for open source compliance. i used it once and they released some phone's (probably was a note1) kernel like a week later.
Kazumara,> It takes them 6 months to 1 year

They don't get to decide that. Per the license the source must be distributed with the software. There is no grace period in there.

Besides the source is ready precisely when they compile the final build, because that what they compile is what they must release.

They are just artificially delaying release.
ReverendIrreverence,What does "having balls" have to do with anything? Answer...not a thing. What's Samsung or Huawei or Xiaomi gonna do when being informed that they are not adhering to a legal licensing agreement, get all butthurt and send out their deathsquads? 
BurgerUSA,Xiaomi is easier to bully because it is the honest one. Samsung and Huawei however do not even release source codes for lots of their devices. It's something like being scared to stand up to a bully and then bullying the weakest kid. This twitter guy is bullying the weakest kid. He is no hero.
PlqnctoN,> Samsung and Huawei however do not even release source codes for lots of their devices.  

The source code of what? We are talking about the Linux kernel source here and IIRC Samsung and Huawei do provide kernel source. Do you have a source on your claim?
BurgerUSA,Are you fucking stupid? 
benjimaestro,Try not to insult other users.
BurgerUSA,He is asking me dumb questions trying to provoke me and I got provoked. But thank you for the warning!
Sunny_Cakes,Forgive him, he got a little too triggered.
