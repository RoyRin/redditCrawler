vaderdarthvader,My internet has been spotty all day, so when this gif loaded slowly and froze on that guys face, it gave me the time to think to myself: "Oh, man. This gif is going to make me cringe. I just know it. I mean, sure, I may be judging a book by a cover, but something about the way he sniffs his wine with that stupid smile on his face..."

The gif did not disappoint.

Mayans94,Thank You, I have been struggling to deal with my break up and wondering why I'm not good enough. Why I've been left to rot. I needed this. I am not the problem. There were flaws like any relationship. But I never once thought of giving up. It was her who decided to give up, her who decided I wasn't worth it. Thank you for bringing me back to my reality that I am worth it and I'm stronger than I think. 
TheMicredible,I think OP and you have put things into better perspective. Thank you!

MaTArcher,Staying NC is a must, 

But it doesn'T erase the bouts of anger I Get when I think about how some people can throw away a 4 year story, end it over text and jump into a new relationship weeks later.

You confront them about it, and they pretend that they were never happy for 4 years and that they are now happier in their new life weeks later...

You sit there and wonder WTF just happened, and after 60 days NC you feel a lot better but still not completely "Healed" I mean do you ever completely forget something like that? Don't you always remain a little bitter when you think back at that relationship? The only thing that could really make it soothed is if she contacts me one day with atleast a partial apology of how things were ochestrated.

Lovely post, I feel ashamed of being vulnerable to someone who can run away so easily to a new guy.
revenant3,It’s not shameful to care.  I felt like this for a bit as I processed my “stuff”.  It says a lot to know you processed it fully... and when that day comes that you are over it, and it will come,  it will be more like you know why others do that kind of thing, hopping into something new when they haven’t gotten through or worked through their stuff.  What’s a shame is for people to go through their lives never realizing that or when it’s too late.
MaTArcher,Thanks, makes a lot of sense, the healthy and right way is the hardest work but probably pays off.

Cyn0nymous,I know it would be contrary to what most people would advise to do, but I greeted my ex on New Year’s, just thanking them for being a big part of the last year and that I wish them the best for the next year. Months ago it would’ve been hard for me to do so since I found myself too attached and emotional to them, since they broke up with me (we were on good terms, I think). But after a few months of reflection and experiences, I find myself not romanticizing and holding on to the feelings I once had for her. To be honest, I didn’t think she’d reply; she did and instead of butterflies, I felt a sense of peace. 
And that was when I knew I was going to be okay.


Happy New Years to all y’all!

UHPokePanda,I was surprised at reading rule #6 because it goes against NC, but I get the point. Some people just feel the need to try and do everything they can. I know in the past, I thought I gave up too easily, so I learn to try my best in knowing that I did everything I possibly could.

I wished I had listened to my gut as Rule #3 states, I just did not want to assume something was up, but I remember her feeling distant. Instead I assumed it was because she had woken up early and had a long day and was tired.
nartiz,You see rule 6 everyday here . And even if they don't break NC the speech is the same, the media stalking . And I agree with OP there's people that can be shouted punched and they will commit the same mistake again.
For rule 3 some of us had that also " why she didn't got excited when I said we would move together soon." " why last week the calls became 5 minutes instead of half an hour " :)

But how do you not expect a relationship to last forever yet not go into every relationship with the mindset that it's going to end anyways? I mean, you have to believe that there's some future for the relationship or why be in it at all?

wonder_wang,> "Continuing on as if everything is okay, responding “I love you too” to your partners “I love you” when you plan on ending things the next day or week is LYING." 

This hits close to home. When I confronted my ex about that, he said "but I do love you". Such bullshit. In the end I just concluded that his definition of love is different than mine. In his mind it's "I love you but I've decided this is not working." That shit got me in a confused loop for almost a year after the initial break up. I couldn't understand what does he mean by he still loves me, there must be something left if he still says that.  Finally I just decided I can't take this anymore. "I love you" doesn't mean anything to some people. 
Velvet_Minotaur,I also got this...mine came in the form of "I love you, but in a different way." When I told her to stop texting me so I could heal she said, "What, so I'm not allowed to care about you anymore?"

It's just a really difficult part of human relationships...for both sides, honestly. It must be hard for them too, to see you hurt and knowing they are the cause. My sympathy is limited though; at the end of the day they think they can do better than you, and so they leave the relationship instead of fighting for it.

I hope to find a love that endures.
chelss42,They treat you as an option and have the gall to say I still care about you? Lol people are stupid
MaGaGogo,> at the end of the day they think they can do better than you, and so they leave the relationship instead of fighting for it.

Same situation and in my case, my ex was able to leave me only when he *thought* someone better had found him. This coworker who expressed her feelings to him and who convinced him to come live with her 15 minutes (literally) after he left our apt for a "break". After a 5 years relationship. This new love who, in 2 weeks with her, made him almost vegan and brought him in her family at Christmas. While she witnessed him manipulating, lying and cheating on me, emotionally abusing me. Saying it was "normal to act like that in a special context".

So yeah. Better than me, really? I just *know* that I'm better than that. At least I have more ethics and self respect. And writing it down helps, so thanks for reading me =)

fuckinnobody,I'm reeling from a relationship that basically ended in mid summer 2017, but we still live together. We live together because I wasn't given the benefit of knowing what she was truly feeling in the months leading up until I confronted her on why she was being so shifty. Why things weren't "the same." 

Suddenly I was the guy getting up to speed. It was fucking devastating being unloaded on - blindsided even when you were led to believe that things were pretty good.  

I realized we didn't communicate the same. She communicated for shit, and the result is that once I figured it all out I had no choice but to give her 60 days to get the fuck out. She and her 19 year old daughter.

The emotional heartache over the last 50 days has just been terrible. I had no choice but to give her a reasonable time frame to move out (by law) but she had every chance before then to approach me rather than let her true feelings well up. 

It's like you said, it was her responsibility to let me know how she felt. The few times I asked - it was "you get what you put in." That only made me try harder. It then it graduated to "I'm not sure we see eye to eye." With me trying to convince her otherwise, and culminated on Christmas day where we both said "what the fuck are we doing?"

It's not fun at all to be the last to know that a relationship is failing. I never imagined in a million years the person I trusted and cared about the most couldn't just come to me, even if in tears to tell me how she felt.

Talk about feeling used.

ExtraGoods,Thank you! Similar to what happened to me. My ex claims that the "hints" were there for many months. But the only real conversation about leaving because of "these problems" was the final conversation. They gave no opportunity to work it out. Every day I still think about what I did wrong or could've done different. But I was already giving my best and it was not good enough to them. 

I didn't stand in their way because I cared for them and let them do what they believe was best for them. I'm really hurt by their decision, and miss sharing this world of experiences with someone. But I'm starting to realize it's the act not the person which I miss. The person is forever broken to me. 

Thanks for giving me new insight.

FrauAja,My boyfriend said he loved me on monday but broke up with me two days later via phone call saying that he lost feelings for me. It was after our first big fight (we've been together for 6 months). He told my bestfriend who is our mutual friend before he told me. She then tried to somehow prepare me for what will hapen. HE FUCKING SPOKE HONESTLY ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP TO HER RATHER THAN TO ME AND I WAS HIS GIRLFRIEND BACK THEN. It's been almost a month and I still feel terrible, but l'm doing my best to get over it and move on.

AsleepPhilosophy,I can feel the rage but you're entirely right.

I got ghosted---gasp!---and I wanted to set him right for the first months after it happened. But as we were in an LDR and I was blocked, I felt it unnecessary and I just hesitantly decided to refocus all my energy on me. Now I see him for what he really is, someone who couldn't do a difficult conversation with someone he claimed to love and just a person who shouldn't be in a relationship.

You all deserve more, people.

FromTheCaveIntoLight,ill play devils advocate and just state that this has happened and will continue to happen for millenia. No one in this world owes you anything. Sure, it would be nice if more people were decent and told you how they left right away, but thats fairy tale shit. In the real world, when your SO starts seeing the end of the relationship, they start shopping around and dont actually break up with you until they have another option locked in or at least a solid plan of exit, which can take some time. You expect what you think is right, but in most cases youll end up disappointed, not just in relationships, but life in general. Everyone is selfish and will act accordingly when it comes down to it. I was left the same way. she probably knew 2-3 months before she was out but it hit me like a mac truck when the day finally came. Two weeks later shes with someone else. That relationship lasted maybe 2 months before she was being abused and then the breadcrumbs started coming in. I ignored and now i think she in another relationship bc she has issues and cant stand to be alone. But thats besides the point. Heartbreak and breakups suck. Once someones minds made up, thats usually it. Even if they bring up what they think is wrong, it most likely wouldnt change the fact that they flat out just dont find you attractive enough to stay with anymore, which, in most cases, is why they leave anyway. 
MaGaGogo,I'm not sure I get your point. You don't just "fall out of love", there are reasons for this. The biggest problem is not addressing these reasons when it's still time.
FromTheCaveIntoLight,You can’t negotiate desire. It’s a law of nature. Talking will not fix the problem. 
MaGaGogo,Well, same thing. Desire don't just disappear like that in one day. It's more of a spectrum than anything else.

And anyway, how can you be so sure that you can't negotiate desire? (we're talking about sexual desire, right?) What's this law of nature you're referencing to exactly?
FromTheCaveIntoLight,Desire disappears at different rates for everyone and how can I be sure you can’t negotiate desire? Use your brain, have you ever stopped playing with a toy or given up a sport or anything for that matter that you once desired? Or broken up with anyone? It just goes and no one, not even the voice in your head can change how you feel. Again, desire cannot be negotiated. You can’t talk your way into having someone truly desire you, it happens organically. 
AsleepPhilosophy,I partly agree. I think you owe it to someone you're in a relationship with to be honest about things because this is a person who has invested in you, but in reality, it doesn't always happen and people can just choose the easy way out.

To everyone's who's been blindsided, take comfort in the fact that the relationship failing is not your fault.
newleaf2018,Also, if you are in a relationship I would argue that you DO owe your partner a conversation. Yes we can say no one in life owes us anything, but people who don’t pay us the bare minimum of respect, loyalty, trust, and empathy do not get a free pass just because that’s life.

I know you’re just playing devils advocate, I just have no time for dick exes right now 
FromTheCaveIntoLight,You can argue all you want but that’s not reality. Think of it like a job. If one day you want quick, and you’ve thought about it for a month or two, there’s nothing that makes you have to give a two week notice or an explanation. That isn’t nice to do to an employer but people do it all the same. No different from a relationship. Sure two week notice is a courtesy but not required. Some people just suck. And what’s a conversation really going to change? Nothing.   
newleaf2018,Employment is very different from a relationship. So no.
FromTheCaveIntoLight,I wouldn’t say very different but I get where you’re coming from but what you’re asking/venting about is literally never going to change. People will act in accordance with their own self interest. People will be shitty and breakups will more often than not, suck a lot more for one party than the other. Again, even if they told you all the things they hated about you and the relationship, what do you honestly think would change? They lost interest. They checked out. You may be able to extend the inevitable but that’s just wasting more time. 
newleaf2018,The point of this post is that the fault is on the dumper if they behave in this manner. It’s not that this doesn’t happen, because unfortunately it does. I wrote this as a means to comfort those who have been dumped so they know this is not their fault.
FromTheCaveIntoLight,Fair enough. And you’re right, it’s not. Life sucks sometimes and like you said, no one deserves it but life gives all of us things we deserve. What’s done is done as they say. Best of luck on your recovery and know it gets better and if your ex did you wrong, you finally saw the real them. Better off without a person like that in your life. 
newleaf2018,Still makes them a shitty human. 
FromTheCaveIntoLight,So be glad they are out of your life. A conversation isn’t going to change the outcome.
newleaf2018,You never know
FromTheCaveIntoLight,Actions speak louder than words my friend 
funnyunfunny,I disagree. I mean, I agree that it won't change the outcome, but damn would it have felt better to get some fucking closure.
FromTheCaveIntoLight,Closure is an illusion and doesn’t exists. It’s just your bruised ego talking. 
funnyunfunny,What... even. That's incredibly mean and unsympathetic of you to say. I can assure you, it's not my ego- it's the fact that I was left out of the blue after 1 year and 3 months and called needy and desperate for wanting to meet him up WHILE we were dating, it's the fact that I was thrown away and felt used while he could fuck off and ignore me without even giving me a chance to reply. Closure exists, just because you deny it doesn't mean it doesn't.
FromTheCaveIntoLight,What closure do you speak of? Its not mean of me to tell you the truth. 

> I can assure you, it's not my ego- it's the fact that I was left out of the blue after 1 year and 3 months and called needy and desperate for wanting to meet him up WHILE we were dating, it's the fact that I was thrown away and felt used

that sounds a lot like your ego to me.

heres something that will help https://redd.it/7ihcyr


funnyunfunny,Just finished reading, doesn't apply to me entirely. There were very tangible reasons he left me, that he shared with his friends but refused to share with me when I asked. Sure, this might read to you as "how DARE they break up with me!!!" but closure is incredibly important to heal faster and better post-breakup. If I had that closure, about why he did the things he did, the time I spent emotionally distraught and depressed would have been halved.
FromTheCaveIntoLight,whatever tangible reasons he left, it all boils down to the same. No longer desired you. Even if he told you what you needed to change, would you have changed who you are for his happiness? Do you think it would really make a difference in his desire for you. It sounds like this is a very recent BU youre going through and in the denial/ anger stage. At the end of the day, how someone leaves you is a pretty good summary of their true character and is basically all the "closure" you really need. But if you think him sitting down with you and telling you that (for example) youre not mature enough, youre fiscally irresponsible, youve gained some weight, bedroom life is getting boring, ect. do you really think that would have "halved" your feelings?

qwertyvn5,"Let’s be friends," is still possible, is it not?
newleaf2018,In my case, I do not want to be friends with someone who treated me the way he did and said the things he said to me. In my personal opinion, if your partner was truly your friend, they wouldn’t blindside you with a breakup. They would want to make things work. Often times they are only saying “let’s be friends” to ease their guilt.

crunchiestcroissant,Ugh, mine broke up with me oud the blue after I told him my visa extension hadn’t been approved. Two days before that it was all “you’re the love of my life”. Trying to make him understand how cruel that was, taking away my right to even talk about it or be part of the decision, has been like talking to a fucking brick wall, and it’s completely destroyed the memories of what was otherwise an amazing 2 year long relationship.
MaGaGogo,> it’s completely destroyed the memories

I get that, after a 5 years relationship. Sometimes I still think fondly about some memories, but soon after I'll just think about what he done and... everything is polluted.

littleshoop,I am relating to this on sooooooooo many levels. My ex did the same to me 4 weeks ago and I still can’t wrap my head around it. I feel like he didn’t gave us a chance at all.. I mean he invited me to spend Christmas with his whole family after a year and a half of dating telling me how happy he is I’m part of the family. We’ve been LDR the whole time and he broke up two days before I was supposed to go visit him ( he had chosen my tickets and all and I bought them ). The day before the BU even, he was saying how much he loves me and want to be there for me and can’t wait to see me ( and I was not fishing for it.. it came from him. I wasn’t saying I love you he was) . Then the next day he breaks up over the phone in tears.. and I still feel like it’s all my fault that he broke up with me. 
I didn’t know it would hit me so hard tbh.. it’s the first time I am this upset over a break up. And even if after four weeks I am busy and hanging out with friends and taking care of myself he is ALWAYS on my mind.. and I’m so tired of it. I just want to stop loving him so much.. I dream about him almost every night.. and my dreams are so vivid it’s tiring. Any tips on how to completely move on ? ( knowing that I have been seeing other people and that we have been NC )

moffattron9000,There are plenty of forwards that are that broad shouldered. Admittedly, most of them are Samoan and were five feet tall at eight, but it's not out of the ordinary.

Then again, rugby is a silly game that takes ties for series that only happen every twelve years, so maybe it's moot.

cabbage623,Also the original Dragon Ball. Also Z
Mobile_Profile,Not Dragonball. Goku actually lost quite a bit in the show.
frogbound,In DB it was about becoming a great martial artist. Getting smarter, training mind and body. It was never about life and death until Piccolo showed up towards the end. 
Since DBZ they fought for their lives and the lives of Planet Earth... now they fight for the survival of their universe.

The sad thing is that every character not Goku or Vegeta are being put on the sideline and are spectators/commentators. They might have an episode or two where they can show of their growth but their overall story doesn't really progress.

I hope we can get something better in the future.
I_Am_Not_A_NSA_Agent,I am still pissed that Gohan was not the strongest character by now. Now before you call me crazy, let's take it back to the Perfect Cell, Beginning of the Cell Games sagas...

Goku lost gains from heart virus so he knows from Future Trunks that Gohan ends up one of the only survivors. He realizes this and evens says to Gohan himself when they enter the Hyperbolic Time Chamber that he wants Gohan to be stronger than him. He trains Gohan much harder than even Gohan himself realized and had him achieve Full Power Super Sayian by making SSJ their natural form thus fully mastering it and being able to achieve much higher levels of power. Plus in the Chamber when training Goku witnessed first hand for a brief moment Gohan hidden powers and knew he was closer than ever to having them awaken and that, that is just what it might take to fully ascend regular Super Sayian. Goku was so calm up until the Cell games because he knew Gohan was more than strong enough so he had no need to worry. Gohan was stronger than Goku and about close to equal to Cell when both at full power and if Gohan gets pushed hard enough, his powers will awaken, and that combined with becoming a Super Sayian 2 would be way more than enough to defeat cell. Gohan does all this. And to use the final bit of power during the Kamehameha clash, he wakes up the last tiny bit of hidden power he has left and now has it fully awoken. So after Cell and before Buu, Gohan was the Strongest Character. 

Now let's say during the 7 years or so that took place between the Cell Games and Great Sayiaman saga, that Gohan went back into the Time Chamber and finished his few months he had left from training with Goku because remember they left the room early. And then he used his next full year inside of it. And then during the rest of the time he trains in a 500× gravity ship like Vegeta and at the same intensity of training as him. Maybe achieve Full Power Super Sayian 2 and fully master that form. Gohan by the time Buu comes around would have been unstoppable. Add in his training with the Z sword and Elder Kai on top of that! He would be untouchable 
frogbound,Which would also make sense when you take the proper shonen approach. The target audience is 13-18 year olds. So Gohan would be the proper role model for the boys out there who witness him surpassing his father and taking over the main role.  
Sadly Toriyama-san didn't agree and kept Goku and Vegeta (the fan favorites!) in the driver seat and gave everyone else mere spectator seats for the spectacle.  
Then he went on an chose Toyotaro-san who we have to thank for the funny God of Destruction designs.. but as a true successor to Toriyama-san he continued with Goku and Vegeta at the helm.  
  
I just wish Goten and Trunks / Pan and Bulla had more of a chance in that universe but Super will end soon.
Mobile_Profile,I agree with you 100%. My point was that the whole Goku overcoming all odds wasn't a thing until DBZ. Even then he still lost against raditz(kinda) and cell.
shogunreaper,> Even then he still lost against raditz(kinda) and cell.

tbf he didn't even really try to beat cell.


FatChocobo,> It was never about life and death until Piccolo showed up towards the end.

BlazeBloom,Too bad the power ups aren't as cool as in the original series. 
wellmade-mango,Too bad it isn't as cool as the original series overall. 
Roland_Traveler,Nostalgia, that’s probably why.
l0w_key,na man, I just finished re-watching DBZ, its still badass as hell.
flamethekid,Most forms of dbz on the internet is the remastered version to keep up with modern times they remaster like every 10 years

The original TV airing of the show which you can actually still occasionally see in other countries like Brazil and the like have chopper animation than super 
BlackNike98,The tone of this DBS is just not as serious as DBZ. Remember when Vegeta completely fucked the fat android with his Big Bang attack? Shit was dark as hell. DBS is too childish I'd say. 
Sprickels,The animation is terrible too, why can't they afford to give the show a bigger budget and more time to produce episodes?
jojoman7,DBZ always had bad animation. You're just nostalgic. In 2018 we have people freezeframing every in-between to dissect on 4k monitors. We watched DBZ in 480p on CRTs or on VHS. Granted, I think the digital coloring and shading looks terrible, but that's anime in 2018.
Sprickels,I'll always prefer hand drawn cels over digital.
avech,With the need for constant feedback and new shows thanks to the immediacy of internet streaming globally it makes it really hard to have stronger animationnin such a short time. As soon as somebody is done with anime X they immediately move to Y and demand season 2 of anime X. The avility to consistently output shows at a high pace ia really the only thing keeping some production houses alive. The animatiom takes a bit of a hit but if series are being defined by the 2 seconds of poor animation that get scattered throughout an episode and not by the actual content of the episode, or even the aeries on a whole then who is really at fault? Obviously we want to have the best possible quality for our beloved shows, but the reality is, unless you are demanding to wait the 4 years necessary to have an extremely high production quality like in say a Ghibli movie, then a minute of bad animation shouldn't concern you too much.
Unclehouse2,Have you watched passed BotG and RoF arcs? The animation is fucking great now. There is no logical reason to bitch about the animation anymore.
shogunreaper,> Have you watched passed BotG and RoF arcs? The animation is fucking great now. There is no logical reason to bitch about the animation anymore.

you have rather low standards for "fucking great"

it's passable, but dbs does not have the budget to be great.
shidpoad,>  The animation is fucking great now.

You need to have your eyes checked or stop lying. QUALITY abounds, and the fights are still choppy as fuck, even when they recycle the same fight over and over.

Unclehouse2,You need to lower your expectations. We aren't going to get consistently amazing animation like in episode 109-110. Obviously. And yeah, they have bank animation that has been used several times over by now. So What? I'm just glad that we have Super because I never expected we would ever get another Dragon Ball series. Take things for what they are worth and roll with it. Things have vastly improved since the beginning of Super and I'm satisfied with what I've been given.
Im_French,It's not nearly as godawful as it was in the past, but "fucking great" is a huge overstatement, it's serviceable at best.
wafflepiezz,Depends. Some episodes looked absolutely insane.
Roland_Traveler,Depends on what scenes. Some look beautiful, others are just good.
Sprickels,I'm glad they improved it, but the rehashing of the movies we've already seen and how ugly it looked really soured me
Unclehouse2,Yeah it was pretty stupid what they did, but I understand why they did it. That was almost 100 episodes ago though. Time to move on and appreciate how good it is now.
Sprickels,Honestly it's just weird to me, and it's not just a problem with Dragon Ball, so much anime looks cheap and poorly made, isn't this a huge industry? Put some money and time in it. American cartoons don't have as huge as a following but you can see the love and care put into them
Unclehouse2,As far as I know, these production companies are on some insanely strict and short dead lines. I don't watch a lot of anime these days, but in recent memory, I haven't seen too many terribly animated episodes. Sure, some are better than other (Yuya Takahashi is a fucking pimp), but nothing that stands out as being terrible like episode 5 was.
master6494,>isn't this a huge industry? Put some money and time in it.

That's actually the issue. The industry is huge and there isn't enough animators to work with. Adding to that, the good looking animes are usually a season of 12 episodes every 2 years, you just don't have that kind of time while making a weekly anime like DBS.

This isn't a "throw money to the problem" kind of thing, you can't buy extra hours in a day.

mw19078,That sounded like a logical reason.
blunt_person,DBS airs on sunday morning in Japan, so they are quite restricted to what they can show.

In terms of seriousness, as far as themes go, I don't think Super really lags behind DBZ. The Goku Black arc was all sorts of fucked up, and the show really gets a more mature tone around episodes 35-40ish... like, they must've switched up writers. And even though people get salty about Vegeta not winning against the main enemies, his character development throughout the series is just monumental -- his transition into a full family man, while not losing his trademark personality, is just awesome, imo. He's still harsh as fuck, he's Vegeta, but he genuinely shows care for his kids, and the Saiyans from Universe 6.


daffydubs,Yea but in ToP you see Freeza get straight worked like a mofo. He goes from cocky shit talking to being drug around by his tail and smashed into everything. 
Ivanator2294,I don't really think it's a bad thing to be childish. DB was a light-hearted adventure for most of it, DBZ was super serious action, and DBS is a mixture of both.
shogunreaper,db was way better as well.
frogbound,Yea they wen't back to the DB style of story telling with a lot more funny stuff but Champa should really STFU already this guy is so freaking annoying.
Devidose,Or flat out nuked some of the audience during the Buu saga after turning. 
Pollomonteros,Or when he blew up that truck with some dude still inside while fighting Android 18
AvidasOfficial,I dunno, I'm really enjoying this ultra instinct transformation. It feels like Super Saiyan Blue should have done in my opinion.
FatChocobo,Where will they go next from UI, though? I'm not really sure what other powerups they can give beyond this at this point.
jomontage,Seeing as the show only has 4 episodes left before an indefinite hiatus the answer is probably nowhere. 
FatChocobo,Yeah, it feels like they're cashing out with this a bit. 
Spore124,Because this upcoming week won't have an episode, there's actually only 3 episodes of Super left.
jason2306,Wtf man that's surreal
Slogfarts,At least that first episode when it happened. Up until that point I felt like I was stuck in an abusive relationship with the show only for that to air and found myself thinking “wait, is this good? Is this actually a really good episode?”
phoenixrawr,Yeah ToP has had some good moments but feels kinda underwhelming a lot of time. It's kind of bad when a universe gets erased and all you can really say is "Thank god, no more POWER OF LOVE episodes..."
blunt_person,I'm in the camp that enjoyed most of the power of love episodes, simply because of the gag moments it generated... like #17 mocking their intros by grandstanding his own introduction (I am the Android Number 17 of Universe 7, the warrior who has defeated Kakunsa and (whatshername), and I am here to defeat you!" ... to the point even #18 decided to fuck with them ("And I am Android #18, Goddess of Universe 7, who has defeated your Goddess Ribrianne, and I am here to become the goddess of all universes!), while Goku just... had no clue how to do it, so he just went "Yo, and I'm Goku"
ushe123,I can now say "Thank god, im not the only one who hated that fat red round looking thing that was only talking about power of love", Phew.
mkicon,The beginning of the tournament dragged a lot of stuff out, then suddenly it kicks into high gear and everyone gets eliminated
Doodenmier,It was a good way for them to poke fun at some anime tropes but yeah, the way they made low power characters rival high power characters and had some lame gimmicky matchups hasn't done the tournament any favors...

divideddarko1,Wasn't it explained very early on that Saiyans got stronger after each battle. So they will always just break limits. 
SmallPl0x,>ACKSHUALLY

  Ah ok that makes it good writing then
blunt_person,Yes, but it was also explained that Goku/Vegeta don't really get stronger anymore after battles (not noticeably anyway -- it's called a Zenkai Boost), because they are already nearly at the limit of their potential, so any gains they get from battling are minimal now.

The point of this particular picture tho is that Goku is shattering the final shell that limits his growth, and he's ascending to a state that not even "Gods of Destruction" are able to without millions of years of training.

...because he's Goku.
jellysmacks,What I have always thought on this is that they are leveling at this rate because they are Saiyans. Yes it may take gods and other beings a massively long time to reach that power, but perhaps Saiyans can naturally level this fast with training, and the only reason nobody has known this before is because no Saiyan ever pushed this hard. Now Goku and Vegeta are being constantly forced to their max potential, and so the full ability of a Saiyan to gain power is being shown. That’s my opinion.
jackmusick,Yep. I’m pretty okay with it since that’s just how their race functions. It’s within defined rules. 

My only issue is we rarely get to see them seem as powerful as they’re portrayed to be. I think that’s why I liked the Golden Frieza movie so much. We get to the end of the movie and they made it out like they were just toying with him. That’s the way it should be sometimes after you’ve passed your “god” form and have been training with a God of Destruction. 
wafflepiezz,Yeah. Zenkai boost, they get stronger each time they get beat down

haier,Goku is basically the new Gurren Laagan. he keeps breaking limits, increasing his power and now vegeta is following the same direction. 

Basically DBZ has become Tengan Toppa Gurren Laagan, but with no cool mecha, no good storyline, no fan service. It seems like all the series doing is focusing only on Goku with how unlimited his being is until everyone eventually stop watching and give up on the series. 

Akira Toriyama ought to be pissed and depressed at what they did to his creation.
blunt_person,> Goku is basically the new Gurren Laagan. he keeps breaking limits, increasing his power and now *vegeta is following the same direction.*

"ACHKTUALLY", one of the refreshing things about DBSuper atm is that Vegeta for once realized that he needs to stop trying to chase Goku and get stronger in his own way, so the two have split progression paths.


shogunreaper,> Goku is basically the new Gurren Laagan. he keeps breaking limits, increasing his power and now vegeta is following the same direction. 

he's always been doing that, the only difference is he only had to it occasionally since it was 1v1 fights and then it was over for years.
serosis,> Akira Toriyama ought to be pissed and depressed at what they did to his creation.

So he should be pissed and depressed at what ***he*** created?

ggg730,I noticed that a lot of kinda low level actors are getting thrown under the bus lately for kinda inconsequential things. Franco kinda and Aziz was definitely. Seems a little dodgy if you ask me.

LoveDiLeague,Who knows? Maybe they pissed off a producer with influence or they won't speak about something they don't believe in. Hollywood likes to keep that shit under wraps. 
aaybma,Or they got accused of some sexual misconduct during an anti-sexual harassment movement.  I can guarantee that if Polanski made another movie, it would be snubbed in Hollywood during the current climate. 

Aziz hasn't come off to bad anyway, he'll bounce back.

Brandonlngram,What was the most surprising thing about the NBA when you first joined it?
Bklyn_Nets,Just how tiring the NBA season is. All the flying/late night arrivals/changing of time zones catches up to you after awhile 
Brandonlngram,Thanks for responding bro!

pagereader,Injuries have been a concern for you these past few years. Once you recover, are you going to change your basketball style for safety or stick to what you've been doing? 
Bklyn_Nets,I have been super on top of my sleep and nutrition for quite some time, but the one thing I am doing is rebuilding my body from the ground up. Every joint and muscle, as well as tweaking a lot of my movement patterns to become even more efficient, healthy and explosive. It's a daunting endeavor but I have the time and the willingness to take this challenge head on! It's been super fun so far.
coolaznkenny,You ever called up Goran Dragic and see what kind of exercises he did to stay out of injuries? 
boltonstreetbeat,Hey Jlin, this is interesting, but what's it actually mean? You can't rebuild what you have - you know, joints are joints - so how does an older guy like me achieve what you are trying to achieve?

HappyNewWar,So Jeremy, I hear you went to Harvard... Can you tell me which is heavier, a pound of rocks or a pound of feathers? Thanks.
Bklyn_Nets,Middle school riddles won't cut it. You're gonna have to come at me with some more high-level stuff than that. 
LZ_Khan,Hmm but you didn't answer the question..
aaahhhh,Then what about a pound of gold versus a pound of feathers?
fvertk,It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,
Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.
It lies behind stars and under hills,
And empty holes it fills.
It comes first and follows after,
Ends life, kills laughter.
ghostdunks,Dirty hobbitses!!
thejewznextdoor,Nothing?
pmedthrowaway,Your momma's beaver dam.
thejewznextdoor,Oh, trust me, it can be smelt.
drum35,Silence? 
jcgotigers,Ive wondered this for years... What happens if Pinocchio says his nose is about to grow?
dew89,There's no rule for Pinocchio that his nose can only grow if he lies, right?  So presumably his nose would grow.  His nose grows if he lies but not only if he lies, so there is no paradox.
isawradeadguy,Plus, I don't think the ability/curse is involved with telling the future.

Like, what, are people saying he could say this dice will roll "x" and say all 6 numbers, except one number his nose won't grow?

Nah son. It don't work like that. Him saying "my nose will grow" is just not a statement, not a fact.
il_CasaNova,The answer is the pound of feathers, because you'd have to live with what you did to those poor birds. 
post_ewing,This a great alternate answer

Red_Lightning,Thanks for doing this Jeremy and the team! I signed up for STM tickets partially because of Jeremy's signing and although you haven't been able to play as much as originally expected I do not regret the decision.

A few from me:

* The team looks like it's really embraced the family culture, and all the players have bought in to it. Does that make it any tougher to deal with when trades happen as it has a few times already (Bojan to the Wizards, Brook to the Lakers, Booker/Kilpatrick leaving in the Philly trade)?
* Much has been said about your connection to Kenny Atkinson and his talent in developing players - yourself as the big example and Rondae and Spencer are having big years this year. Where would you say Sean Marks influence has been on the organization been most visible?
* Fans and the media seem to be always looking for that unicorn rookie that makes a huge impact in his rookie season, but for every LeBron and Embiid there are a lot more players who seem to take a huge jump out of seemingly nowhere later in their career. Rondae and Spencer are having breakout years, and even yourself had bounced around a bit before you caught your big break on the Knicks. How do you think that moment comes?

Bklyn_Nets,1. It's definitely tough and we're a close-knit group. Book and SK were awesome people and I was close with both of them so it was tough to see them go.
2. Sean has been visible everywhere. Literally everything. He's changed the whole culture and made it all about taking care of the players and their families, while eliminating off-the-court distractions. I also love Kenny, thats my guy. I cant wait to absolutely destroy him in 1 on 1 like the old days when I get healthy enough.
3. The moment is a combination of good, consistent habits and the right opportunity. Im super proud of Rondae and Spence!! They deserve it but they've also put in so much unseen work
Red_Lightning,Thanks for the response, Jeremy!

Loving the team and effort and the games are always fun. Definitely renewing for next year so hope we can see you on the court a lot!
BKtoDuval,Glad one of the Nets sub crew got a question answered?
Red_Lightning,He answered the three questions for all of us, bro! :D
Lin_Fan_From_BK,bruhhh that's like 3 questions
Red_Lightning,Hey, I didn't see any rule saying you had to limit yourself to one question :)

SBmachine,What Naruto character do you relate yourself to the most? 

Since Naruto is now over, have you been watching any other anime? 
Bklyn_Nets,Naruto himself!! Stubborn, brazen, big dreamer, loud/obnoxious (only my family and close friends can vouch for me here haha)
Brandonlngram,Do you watch Dragon Ball Z/Super at all? 
Romo_is_GOAT,Yo is super better than GT 
Brandonlngram,Easily. Watch the movies BoG and Resurrection F and skip the first 2 arcs to save time. Well worth it.
Romo_is_GOAT,Ok. I’m rewatching dragon ball rn but I wasn’t sure about super. GT sucked balls, even ssj4 was underwhelming 
Xenostarz,Super isn't as good as DBZ but it's waaaaaaay better than GT and feels like a true successor.
heyiknowstuff,At least GT was we'll produced though. They just slap together Super every week.

leesanity7,Hey, Jeremy,

The biggest question I've had since your Knicks days was how you handle being a professional basketball player/celebrity and being a Christian at the same time.

What I mean by this is, there are some Sundays when you have games and most likely miss your church services, etc., so do you listen to sermons on your downtime to have somewhat of a personal service? What is your favorite Christian book you'd recommend?

Thanks!
Bklyn_Nets,Yup I listen to a lot of online sermons! Also have bible studies or even just times of sharing with close believers (family, friends, agent, etc)

Illionaireambition,Any thoughts on Korean BBQ?
Bklyn_Nets,Bombbbb. #teamkalbiforlife
emperornel,Come to Picnic Garden at Flushing, NY. Unlimited Kalbi for life
I_RAPE_CELLS,My guy is from Cali. There are soooooo many more options for ayce at better quality and lower prices. Picnic garden hits the spot when the craving gets too big though. I haven't been able to find any other all you can eat kbbq places besides BBQ Villiage which closed, do you happen to know any?
emperornel,There are definitely better options in the world, but currently in NYC Picnic Garden is the only AYCE Korean barbecue restaurant and their best meat coincidentally is Kalbi. I mentioned it because Jeremy Lin is going to be in NYC for the next few years. I miss BBQ Village because their meats were top quality and amazing. Too bad they closed down.

willywater88,
This is not much of a question but I just wanted to share this.


I never had a girl break my heart in my life (mostly because I suck at dating) but when you left the Knicks, I was devastated for months. It wasn't just because I enjoyed watching you play but it was because Linsanity bought my family together in a way that nothing has ever done before. Like many Asian households, my family never expressed much emotion and we rarely did things together so to see my mother and sister who don't know a thing about sports scream and jump for you was one of the happiest times of my life. I hate that the Knicks didn't give you an offer sheet but I am thankful for your time at the garden. My mother actually consider you her adopted second son so if you can't find a place to stay in new york, we always have a couch for you here.


On another note, I started a clothing line that aims to highlight Asians as leaders, attractive and interesting and prioritizes Asian Americans instead of leaving us an afterthought. Is it possible for me to get a couple of shirts to you? The site is 88keysclothing.com if you want to take a look. 
Bklyn_Nets,Thanks for sharing! Cant wait for next season...I hope your family will be brought together to watch our games!

HEELHousell,Hi Jeremy. No questions, just a thank you. Growing up a Chinese basketball fan, I didn't have many players to look up to outside of Yao. But when Linsanity happened I instantly became a fan. My grandparents, who don't watch basketball at all, would watch the Knicks just for you. When I found out you came to Brooklyn I was elated. You're easily one of my favorite players in the league and I want to thank you for being an inspirational figure for myself and other Asian fans alike. Best wishes for a speedy recovery, can't wait for you and DLo to tear up the court together.

carnifex2005,I'm an original Grizzlies fan. We traded for Otis Thorpe from Detroit for a protected draft pick, so I feel your pain watching your position each season hoping that horrible trade wouldn't bite you in the ass. Thank god that pick turned out to be Darko instead of Carmelo, Bosh or Dwayne.

calcology,I posted this in /r/NBA but it belongs here too: This will probably go unnoticed, but I am a die-hard Nets fan. I have an autographed Nets hat of CDR, Ryan Anderson, and Lopez. Lopez has been my favorite Net since Kidd. I am extremely sad, but wish him all the best. I am happy for the team because I think this is a good move for the future, but I still am sad to see Brook go. He was a Net and will remain a Net in my heart.
Advanced-,I just found out today he was traded, had no time to follow the offseasons.

My heart :( I never tought I'd see the day. I fucking love brook, I want the absolute best for him. He was a role model Net in every sense of the word.

Fuck man.... Will be my #2 favorite net for a long long time. I can't take Kidd off #1 though, he's the reasons I am a Nets fan. But Brook is a damn close 2nd.
Pepe_Silvia96,Didn't expect to get this emotional today mane, he really is one of the most lovable dudes in the game. I remember those days back when I thought Chris Douglas-Roberts and Devin Harris were going to lead this team somewhere. A part of me wants to believe that there'll be a reunion in the end when this management crew makes something of the team and Brook is in the back end of his career. If anything, this deal reassures me of that possibility. At the very least the dude took #1 in the franchise's all time points...he owns that honor with a margin of 4 points.
calcology,Really glad he got the Nets record. Was worried he would have gotten shut down before he broke it. Dude was nothing but the definition of class and a team player even on some shitty teams.

  ======= 

script ====15
IrishinManhattan617,I'm just a little suspicious about your story. 

If this is true, why would he write you a glowing review for the world to see?  He could have simply rated you and not written such nice things if his goal is to keep your place a secret. 
LoveBeautyNGlam,I'm not sure I read it as he wanted to keep it a secret. I saw it as his goal was to keep their star ratings down, maybe preventing the host from gaining superhost status and ultimately keep the host from raising prices in the future. 

I do agree that not leaving a written review would match up more with what he told OP but obviously this guest is a fucktard.  

IrishinManhattan617,What I mean by a secret is to keep the general awesomeness of the apartment a secret.  You do that in two ways - low review star rating AND either a bad review or no review at all.  It's totally inconsistent for the guest to give a low star rating and then a glowing review.  Sorry, something just doesn't seem right to me.
Korll,As written in the OP he had given terribly stars and a good written review so the OP inquired.
IrishinManhattan617,I know but think about that.  If the goal of the guest is to hide the awesomeness of the apartment from others, then the guest would (a) give a low star, and (b) give a BAD review.  What motive did the guest have to leave a glowing review if he is trying to reduce demand.  Something just smells off.
brad-corp,The error you have made here is that you have assumed the guest, like yourself, is a rational person. It would seem that they are not rational. Therefore, who knows why they do anything they do? 
IrishinManhattan617,I can assume the guest is irrational. Or the OP. I'm going with the OP only because if the guest is that calculating then it makes no sense he would leave a good review. The alternative theory is that OP may be an attention whore. I may of course be wrong, but I'm going with OP lying. Makes more sense to me -
anonimo99,attention whoring in a tiny sub in a self post.. yep, the OP is that irrational /s

Trump Supporter Cancels Asian Woman's Airbnb stay

Newtothisredditbiz,I don't know what American laws are like, especially under Trump, but this woman would have a slam-dunk discrimination lawsuit in a lot of places.

She's got documentation of her conversations.

No way AirBnB would stand for this either.

I hope this woman sues and wins big.
None,the funniest part is that if she filed in the city, the woman would have to drive all the way down the mountain to go. and even if she loses, she still made her drive all that way
None,Interesting how you think discrimination laws may have all the sudden changed under our new administration.  
trouzy,It ain't that far fetched.  Have you seen the man, or heard anything he has said/tweeted?
None,Rhetoric like this is the problem.  Time to turn the TV off.  
RubberDong,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lfse9ygELs
notoyrobots,Yes things spoken over 20 years ago are super relevant when compared the the *current* president.

Get real.
RubberDong,want something more recent?

here you go

TruthFromAnAsshole,What does deporting illegal immigrants have to do with discriminating against other americans because of the colour of their skin. 

Those are 2 extremely different things, why would you even compare them? 
RubberDong,I am showing that Bill Clinton s rhetoric was exceptionally similar to Trump's yet he was never branded a fascist, racist, sexist, biggott, homophobe, islamophobe, transgenicliquidhelicopter phobe all Amy of that bullshit.

He was not targeted by the media until he ran against Clinton who voted for a wall.

That is all.

Trump never said anything about coloured people. 

It was a reply to the redditor who manipulated by the fake news concluded that Trump is Hitler. 
TruthFromAnAsshole,Man... 

In Bill Clinton's speech he specifically says he wants to deport illegal immigrants **who are arrested for committing crimes**, and when he talks about deporting more people, he qualifies it by saying those who have committed crimes. 

He says they will crack down on illegal hiring so that americans **or legal immigrants** would be able to have those jobs, and that they will deny illegal immigrants welfare benefits.

Then he finishes the speech by reminding the audience that they are a  nation of immigrants, it's just that he wants it done lawfully. 


That is not "exceptionally similar" to Trump's actions toward muslim majority countries and his words about Mexicans. 

"They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists" is not similar to saying you don't want people abusing your welfare system or taking American jobs.


Also this comment from Trump: 

["Sadly, the overwhelming majority of violent crime in our cities is committed by blacks and hispanics"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/342190428675796992)

Here's the thing about this, it's not true. Because if it was true, then I'd have no issue. But I even gave him the benefit of the doubt and pulled the 2013 stats from when he made the comment... and it's not true. https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43


So yes, he gets branded a bigot because he says bigoted things, Clinton doesn't get branded a bigot because he doesn't.

fakenews0923,I can pretty much guarantee what happened here. 

The owner listed the house on Airbnb, gust booked the lowest possible occupancy of 2 people for $39/night. Reported elsewhere. 

The visitors contacted and asked how much extra for 2 more people and 2 dogs. The owner replied $50 (or $49, $39 for 2 more people and $10 for dogs), we cant see all the messages

On the way up the mountain the person sent a text how do we pay you the extra $11. We're nearly there let's stick the boot in and pretend it's ambiguous. 

Of course the owner went ape shit, realizing had been played, she lost her cool.

Unfortunately, in hospitality, in villa industry especially, these words play and twisting, and demands, seem to happened consistently with particular nationalities, those nationalities are all within Asia (not all asian countries though, only some are blacklisted). 

Interesting in this instance the story ran two months later and just so happened to have a TV van on the mountain. This seems like a professional victim imo. But hey ho lefties love this shit

Speaking from experience.

None,The host should have to reimburse her for the gas money and the time spent in, because the host led them to believe that they would have a place and then canceled when they were half way up the mountain... 

I would drag her to small claims, and make her drive all the way to the city
159734682,They both handled the situation poorly. The guest tried to sneak in 4 additional guests on the day of check in, so of course the host went ballistics at being informed at the very last minute, literally minutes before the guests were about to arrive.

The best solution would have been either agree on additional pay, instead of $50 maybe $120 per night, or the 4 guests can try to book their own lodgings on site.

It is unreasonable to force upon the host new conditions which are outside the confirmed booking. Who knows, maybe a month ago, the host might have said she doesn't accept dogs or that 6 guests is too many. The host had no chance to discuss with the guest.
None,> The guest tried to sneak in 4 additional guests on the day of check in, so of course the host went ballistics at being informed at the very last minute, literally minutes before the guests were about to arrive.

that's... not what happened. the guest literally has texts of her asking the host before hand if she can bring 2 extra (it's 4 people total including guest), what the guest *snuck* in was the 2 dogs (one of them was like a purse dog) probably. Which is obviously the guest's fault but it's not as bad as sneaking in 4 additional people. 

they did agree on additional pay, the host said that it's okay that they would have to pay extra, the guest was asking if the host wants the extra in cash, and that's when the host developed Dementia. too bad there's texts to prove it..

I think the point is not simply the host canceled on the guest, the point is that the host brought race into it, and alienated the guest as a foreigner despite the guest being an American. The outrage is more over the fact that the host is a racist about it. it's over the fact that this disgusting woman can take one look at someone's profile picture and determine their nationality for them.
OCedHrt,According to the washington post article the host agreed to the dogs too. Honestly the low price seems the imply it was intentional to trap people.

trouzy,It sounds like the host had a legit reason to turn them away, but then went racist like a moron.  

No way i would let someone bring 2 dogs into my place.


EDIT:  downvotes care to elaborate?
semintesicola,Its ok to get downvots. Check the.ones i will get.
Maybe the host did get into an argument  and the asian chick insisted on what she says it was settled and then.. yeah... the host lost it. Was a moron. And went all racist. The reason to decline maybe wasnt based on race and we all have bad days, but it s not an excuse to act like that. And i wouldnt want here hosting.
trouzy,I gave no excuses.
seahawkguy,because it's normal for people to have one sided arguments?  the host was ranting and raving and the renter was just chatting normally?  none of this makes sense.  I'm sure the renter cherry picked the best messages to post and cleaned out the messages that doesn't paint her in a positive light.
None,https://asamnews.com/2017/04/09/some-still-express-serious-doubts-about-victim-in-racist-airbnb-incident/

the host agreed to the dogs (seemingly reluctantly, but still agreed)
RubberDong,Welp...I am racist because I had to specify that rice cookers are not allowed in the bed room.

Damn Norwegians, always bringing rice cookers
Dai10zin,Without doxing the Airbnb folks, I can say I've seen the original listing (cached) and it specifies in the description that pets are acceptable and that it accommodates up to 4.

Having said that, the "House rules" say it's not suitable for pets (maybe that's a setting toggle?).

So there's a little bit of contradiction there.

Edit: The (cached) site also says $150 per night -- so maybe that was part of the disagreement? I don't use Airbnb, so I don't know if maybe there's a way to negotiate prices or if prices can vary depending on circumstances.
BrometaryBrolicy,Good on you for not doxing ^^^jk ^^^dox ^^^them
Dai10zin,A little research shows they were already doxxed in February when this originally occurred.

At this point I almost (almost) feel sorry for them since they'll have to go through it again, but on a much larger scale.

Anything more feels like overkill.
SuitablyOdd,Doxxing is really crappy, it's amazing what people will justify in the name of internet justice.

This is one for the guest to sort out with AirBnB, which has hopefully been done by now. They'll obviously have access to a lot more information than the video holds. What's important is they do the right thing as far as this case is considered, and send a strong message that racism (guests or hosts) should not be tolerated.
SuitablyOdd,There's no indication that this wasn't already mentioned in the booking. Plenty of AirBnB places welcome animals.


wolf2600,4 people and 2 dogs for $50/night?  Maybe if it were $50/person/night, but not $50 for all 6 occupants.
trouzy,There's no indication she mentioned them.
Swimmingindiamonds,Actually several articles mention the host had agreed to extra guests and dogs beforehand and went back on her word the day of arrival.
ThreeDGrunge,They base that on the one screenshot from the guest saying " YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SAID YES AND WENT BACK ON YOUR WORD."

We do not know the context of any of that.  Most likely the host agreed to 50 bucks a night based on no pets and 2 people. 
trouzy,The initial post mentioned nothing of the like, it showed no proof either.
Swimmingindiamonds,I'm just going to C+P my response to another poster:

One of the [screenshots](http://metro.co.uk/2017/04/07/racist-airbnb-host-banned-for-life-for-cancelling-on-asian-guest-6561287/) shows this part of the conversation.

Guest: YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SAID YES AND WENT BACK ON YOUR WORD. 

Host: Go ahead, I wouldn't rent to u if u were the last person on earth. One word says it all. Asian

I would think if what the guest was saying was not true (that the host hadn't said yes) then the host would point that out rather than going for the racist attack.

Where is proof that the guest didn't bring it up until the last minute?

Edited to add the link re: the screenshot.
trouzy,You've shown nothing get over it.
Swimmingindiamonds,So you don't have proof that the guest didn't mention it until last minute either. Got it!
trouzy,What do you think constitutes proof? Where are the ss of the host saying it was ok, or even the guest asking?
Swimmingindiamonds,The screenshot shows the guest mentioning that the host previously agreed and the host not correcting her. While it's not a concrete proof, it's more than you got.

Besides, you are the one who's saying the narrative presented in the articles published is an incorrect one. So the burden of proof is with you.
trouzy,False.
SuitablyOdd,So in the absence of any evidence we just make wild assumptions in favour of the evidently very racist host?

When you say 'It sounds like the host had a legit reason' what you actually meant was 'There's nothing explicitly disproving my following theory'. So here's a few other unproven possibilities to add to the hosts defence:

* Her home had, moments ago, been burnt down by anti-Trump arsonists so she was in no position to welcome guests.

* Someone had altered her phone so that the word 'Dogs' was changed to 'Asian' for no apparent reason.

* There was never any booking, it's all an elaborate ploy to make Trump supporters look bad. None of the information is verifiable, therefore it must all be untrue.

* The guest drove a crummy hatchback. There's no way she should have to let such an eyesore park on her drive.

Sure, the host tried to make her reasoning for her change of heart easy for us by summarising it in one word. But I just bet it was one of these other things instead.
seahawkguy,so in the absence of the entire chat transcript, you take 2 messages out of context and the host is now a racist Trump supporter?  why is it the renter gets to paint her tragic story but doesn't release the context of the messages?  maybe because she was just as rude causing the host to respond rudely also?

We all know her profile picture is visible as is her name, if the host was anti Asian, why agree to rent to her at all?  there's more to this story than what's been told.  If you point to the host being banned as AirBnB doing due diligence, i wouldn't count on it.  Lyft fired a driver because a passenger complained, until one of his other passengers came forth with video showing the passenger was abusive, not the driver.

I'd hold off on calling host racist until the chat transcript is produced.  Context is everything.  For all we know, the Asian lady might have started it by call the host a red neck or cracker.  It's most likely they were arguing about the dogs and extra two guests and things got heated.
SuitablyOdd,Yeah because the phrase "One word says it all. Asian." could mean *so* many other things.

I'm not an idiot, I wouldn't condemn a person based on a one-sided account of events, but I also won't employ my wild imagination to conjure up scenarios that exonerate someone clearly in the wrong.

For instance:

> I'd hold off on calling host racist until the chat transcript is produced. Context is everything. For all we know, the Asian lady might have started it by call the host a red neck or cracker.

That doesn't make the host not racist. That just makes two racist people. Unless of course you think it's acceptable to throw racist comments out in retaliation?

The most telling part of your argument? You accuse me of labelling the host as a racist Trump supporter. It's not that I've labelled her as a racist that bothers you, it's the fact that she's also a Trump supporter. You've employed the same kind of mental obtuseness required to still support that guy in order to defend a fellow supporter.

That blind scrabbling for reason you mistake for camaraderie means you're indebted to twisting logic to breaking point to defend a clearly racist person to save further tarnish on your dear leader.

For some, AirBnB is still an incredible platform where strangers welcome other strangers into their homes. The colour of their skin, the place of their birth or their ethnicity should not factor into that sharing equation, much as it shouldn't be a factor in many aspects of life. If you don't truly believe that, you aren't the sort of person AirBnB, guests and hosts alike, want in their houses or to be giving money to.

But I forget, you're not here for AirBnB. You're here to defend a fellow supporter. Certainly explains the lack of posts/comments in this sub from you until now.

That indignation you feel? That's because you stepped out of your safe space over at /r/t_d. I'm sure someone there will comfort you.
seahawkguy,Wow. You have quite the imagination there. I really don't care if someone is a Trump supporter or not. If you're racist, you suck. But I also don't go around jumping on bandwagons either. But apparently that's your thing. I'm sure the host wasn't the only one to hurl insults but since you've already decided that the renter is some kind of angel I'll leave you to it and her one sided story is all you need to hear. That fine. You have no idea if they were arguing about the host feeling scammed because the renter wanted to pay cash which is against AirBnB policy. All the context you need is in two paragraphs that only shows what the host is saying and nothing to show what set them off. 

I just discovered this sub today. Judging by your reaction I'm definitely not coming back. You can have this place all to yourself.

CocoaThumper,Bye Felicia
trouzy,The message about 4 guests and 2 dogs certainly makes it sound like the it was news to the host.  And why are you even heading this path anyway?  You agree with my og comment that the host was moronic for being racist yet you go on a weird tirade of nothingness?

There are 2 sides to every story, the guest could have very easily been in the wrong and the host was declining them because the host felt scammed.  From how the woman in the video speaks, it sounds more like she is only bringing 2 friends so the host could have been expecting 3 people and 0 dogs.  I would not take that lightly as a host.

The thing is we dont have the whole story.  We can judge the host for being racist, but we can't color the victim innocent here either as the victim's side is the only story we saw we don't have even half of the truth likely.
Dai10zin,I mention it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/63ria3/trump_supporter_cancels_asian_womans_airbnb_stay/dfxiec1/) but I've seen what I believe to be the original listing (cached) that would have been during President's Day weekend.

In that listing, it states that the cabin has room for 4 and accepts pets.
ThreeDGrunge,Yes and the price was haggled down to 50 bucks a night due to it being for only two people and no pets.  Then three minutes out they add 2 more people and 2 dogs and wanted it for the same price.
SuitablyOdd,> We can judge the host for being racist, but we can't color the victim innocent here either

There's nothing here to suggest the guest is 'guilty' of anything. But that doesn't stop you from presuming the host was in the right:

>It sounds like the host had a legit reason to turn them away

You seem to be stuck on the fact that because the guest hasn't proven beyond doubt that they didn't do something worthy of cancelling a booking, that they must have done something. Kind of flies in the face of 'innocent until proven guilty'. Instead this guest is guilty until they've proven to you their innocence.

Based on what we've actually seen, the host is in the wrong and the guest has done nothing wrong. Sure, it's only one single-sided account which leaves plenty of possibilities open, but without any evidence to support them, they're just that. Possibilities. Much like the 'weird tirade of nothingness' I listed.

What I don't understand is the insistence on that she *must* have done something wrong. Are you simply playing devil's advocate or is there another reason for trying to justify the hosts actions? Genuinely curious.
seahawkguy,Of course there's nothing to suggest the guest was guilty of anything, who's telling their side of the story?  Why must have she done something?  Because it doesn't make sense that her being Asian was not an issue until that night.  Then suddenly it's the only reason she's cancelled?  You're not the least skeptical?
KamenRiderMaoh,There's always two sides to a story, and I would like a full transcript at well. Taking this at face, being Asian myself, I'm sad that whatever squabble they had de-evolved into racism. Why can't we just be friends?

Edit: born and raised in Portland, so if anyone asks where I'm from, Portlandia is my answer.
excusemyexcuses,Are you even reading what this dude's writing? Outside the obvious racist bullshit, he's not picking any side because there is only one side being shown here. 
trouzy,"Sounds like" what is wrong with you.
trouzy,Seriously what are you reading?  Where did i say the guest was definitely wrong and the host was justified?  I didn't say either of those things.

Holypuddingpop,If this happened just as this woman is saying, this is absolutely terrible and that host should be banned for life. 

But before we get out our pitchforks let's keep in mind that this is one-sided version of events, all chat logs and texts were not posted and no identifying information on the host was given so she cannot be found to give her side of this story, there may be more to it. 

I tried searching for a pet-friendly place near big bear that was advertised for $50 a night with a picture similar to the host's photo in the video but I could not find one, not that it means anything. It could be that Airbnb already shut them down. 
None,https://asamnews.com/2017/04/09/some-still-express-serious-doubts-about-victim-in-racist-airbnb-incident/
Holypuddingpop,Thanks for this, but they didn't post the exact exchange that led to the host denying the visit. From what I can tell from the exchanges given, in the video the host seems to be upset that the guest thinks 4 people and 2 dogs can stay for a total of $50 a night. If that's true, her anger would be understandable given the chats posted in the link above where the host explained that 2 extra guests would be $25 each per night, so a total of $50 extra a night -- not total. 

SO it seems to me that there was a misunderstanding on the cost of the room, which is actually what led to the cancellation, not racism. But that being said, the racist comments the host said afterwards are totally unforgivable, and even before that the host's attitude isn't that great to begin with. I still think it was the right decision for Airbnb to ban that host for life. 
None,it's never racism until it happens to you.

look guy, you already admitted that the host made racist comments, the point wasn't that the host denied the guest **solely** based on race, the point was that the host was racist towards the guest, which seems to imply that race may have played a role in the cancellation, but the point was that the host treated the guest, an minority, someone that's also an American, as a foreigner, this is what the outrage is, this is what the guest was crying about, that no matter what she does, how many white dudes she dates, how many white friends she makes, she will always just be a foreigner.
Holypuddingpop,Did I not agree multiple times now that the host's racist comments are unforgivable? 

From my last comment: the racist comments the host said afterwards are totally unforgivable, and even before that the host's attitude isn't that great to begin with. I still think it was the right decision for Airbnb to ban that host for life. 

I'm just saying there seems to be more to the story than the headline and video suggests. Life is complicated, not black and white. Just because a host cancels AND is racist, doesn't mean the host didn't have a justified reason to cancel. I like to get the whole complicated story, even if it doesn't fit into the nice racist bow we all want to see. 
None,> the racist comments the host said afterwards are totally unforgivable,

sure you said that, but you also said this:

>SO it seems to me that there was a misunderstanding on the cost of the room, which is actually what led to the cancellation, **not racism**.

which is a contradiciton

what if i was to tell you that... these two statements are not mutually exclusive, that it's not crazy to think that a person who spews "unforgivable" statements is likely to have acted out of racist sentiments. i've already told you the point, the point is that a racist person did the cancelling, not the cancelling itself. that is for the guest to take the host to court for, those (or lack thereof) facts doesn't stop the host from being branded as a racist
Holypuddingpop,Yes, there is the complexity I am trying to get at. Just because someone is a racist, doesn't mean every decision they make is racist, it's unfair to paint someone like that, especially when there is evidence showing otherwise.  

In this case, it seems (based on looking at the limited information we know described above) that after there was a misunderstanding about the charge of the room the host made a decision to cancel that many other hosts would likely agree with, regardless of the race of the guest or the host. Therefore I call that decision not racist. 

The racist comments she said afterwards are clearly racist, however and awful.   
None,well you certainly have yourself very convinced.

>it's unfair to paint someone like that, especially when there is evidence showing otherwise.

this is meaningless and vague. we have evidence that **corroborate** explicitly that the host is a racist about it. you are saying we have evidence that show "otherwise" what evidence are you looking at? made up evidence? that nobody can point at? or absent evidence that nobody can point at? lack of evidence does not in itself constitute evidence.... 

>In this case, it seems (based on looking at the limited information we know described above) 

haha i lost it here.. the information we have is not by any means "limited" you are obviously more into your own personal agenda than you are into the actual facts of the situation. 

>after there was a misunderstanding about the charge of the room the host made a decision to cancel that many other hosts would likely agree with, regardless of the race of the guest or the host. 

yeah.. despite showing you text messages that contradict this, and literally telling you **3 times**/in every reply that i've made to you so far, what the outrage is about (hint: not just cancellation, but more about what the host said in regards to the cancellation), you still think this narrative is steadfast... and you still live in some sort of an alternate reality where the outrage is at the host for cancelling rather than at the host for being racist in the text messages. 

>Therefore I call that decision not racist.

therefore you **would** reach this conclusion. 

>The racist comments she said afterwards are clearly racist, however and awful.

this is where the outrage really is, the fact that she got cancelled is just more kerosene that's added to the fire. 

It doesn't matter if this is an Airbnb or if this is a subway conversation with a stranger. People do not appreciate being treated as a foreigner despite living here and working hard enough to reach as high as UCLA Law School. 

edit:

>it's unfair to paint someone like that (cancels because racism), especially when there is evidence showing otherwise.

when the host has literally said "I wouldn't rent to you if you were the last person on Earth, one word says it all, Asian"

to you this clearly shows that the host did not cancel because of racism... and this is the absurdity that keeps most rational people up at night.
Holypuddingpop,I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one, we are each just repeating ourselves at this point :) 
None,that's incredibly sad, you started off strongly optimistic, which is completely fine, but you were then provided with ample evidence to corroborate against your optimism, but you do not accept it, stating that it's not good enough for you, because you are looking for something specific and probably unattainable due to w.e reasons. And when you get called out on it sentence by sentence, when your misinformation is corrected, quote by quote, it's just "let's respect everybody's opinion, everyone is entitled to an opinion" 
Holypuddingpop,That's not what I said, if you care to read above you will see.  

It seems that your comments are more about you than they are about me. I wish you luck. 
None,my comments are pretty much just me putting things you said side by side and calling you out for contradictions and misinformation. it has literally quotes of you saying something that's just obtusely wrong, and then followed by me pointing out exactly what is wrong and where you can find the correct information. it is less about convincing you than it is about showing the people that will stumble on this thread, that you are ignorant.

RenegadeComet74,If this is for real, then post the complete log. Not just the screen shots that portray this host as a racist. The host saying that the guests behavior is typically Asian is NOT discrimination. What would be discrimination is if the host said the she was cancelling the stay because she was Asian. Even with this edited piece, the woman hasn't proven that the host cancelled due to her ethnicity. 
RenegadeComet74,Hahaha. I'm getting downvotes for what exactly? Because I'm able to make a distinction between housing discrimination and the host just being a racist??? The two don't necessarily go together. Everyone needs to tap the racist brakes a little these days. 
CocoaThumper,The host cites Trump and then brings up the guests race for what reason then?
RenegadeComet74,Probably because the host is a racist. But as I say again, just because the host said something about the guest being "typically Asian" and that Trump means she can do what she wants doesn't mean that definitely some sort of housing discrimination has taken place. Check your logic.
None,https://asamnews.com/2017/04/09/some-still-express-serious-doubts-about-victim-in-racist-airbnb-incident/
RenegadeComet74,This doesn't prove anything at all!!!! Why even post this? Did you read it? Nothing about her being Asian, just back and forth about the host bending the rules to accommodate her guest. But then the all popular "white supremacy" and idea that only white people are racist got there. Methinks this woman is just a little sensitive right now to the racist fever that's going on that she felt like this would be a good narrative to push. 

Again, just because the host said that her behavior (which is still unknown because the screenshots won't be released) is typically "Asian" doesn't mean that she was discriminated against. 

Here's an example: House rules say that you can't cook fish in the house. Asians love to eat fish. Therefore you can't stay at my house because your Asian. Faulty logic. They need to go back to teaching logic in school rather than all of minorities problems are somehow caused by white people. 
None,it proves that the guest wasn't "behaving like an Asian", that there was an agreement, stupid people asserted (not just said, but went on threads after threads of arguing about it) the guest tried to sneak more people in, but this is more logs, it shows clearly that they are asserting some stupid racist ignorant fantasy fact that'll make this all alright. 

the host went on a cliché zombie rant about foreigners and Trump, kind of like the one you're doing here about 

>But then the all popular "white supremacy" and idea that only white people are racist got there. Methinks this woman is just a little sensitive right now to the racist fever that's going on that she felt like this would be a good narrative to push.

no... i think you should spend some time in Korea, they will treat you the same and you can explain to the expats there how overtly sensitive they are being. 

i think the sad thing is, in the US, immigrants have more of a presence here, and instead of letting them become Americans by you know... treating them like Americans, you alienate them. like what the host did here, the guest has been in this country for 23 years, since 3. do you think the guest is going to go back to Korea? or stay in America and raise a bunch of American kids. well according to the host, her kids won't be American, they'll be foreigners, well guess how these kids are going to grow up? this is how you have a guaranteed level of distrust amongst each other as citizens of this country, you are going to have big problems when shit hits the fan and have to depend on each other. (or better yet, depend on each other's loyalty to the nation)
CocoaThumper,Idiot. be gone
seahawkguy,that's what I'm saying.  I feel that the transcript would show the renter in a bad light which is why we'll never see it.  the argument is probably about payment and price.  Which as an Asian person, i can confirm, we're cheap.
crackanape,> The host saying that the guests behavior is typically Asian is NOT discrimination.

Whatever you wish to call it, it's unacceptable.
seahawkguy,if it's unacceptable, why doesn't the renter release the transcript so we can see what she called the host.  People who rent on AirBnB don't go full racist out of nowhere.  I want to see the context of the messages.  Did she call the host a red neck?  A cracker?  why so one sided?
crackanape,Well, Airbnb's going to decide what to do, and they have the full conversation. There's no advantage to trying to pressure Airbnb by releasing the anti-Asian message if they could just turn around and point to an anti-white one.
Holypuddingpop,Well the host could have cancelled for non-racist reasons, then threw out racist comments afterwards, that is still completely wrong. 
None,Her statement regarding typically Asian behavior is evidence that she discriminated based on guests race. But yeah, there are two sides to the story as many on here are pointing out. 
notoyrobots,> The host saying that the guests behavior is typically Asian is NOT discrimination.

No, it's just flat out racist. There is no such thing as "typically" asian behavior.
RenegadeComet74,Yes there is. 
Swimmingindiamonds,Care to elaborate?

Are there typical white people behavior too? What about black people?
RenegadeComet74,Sounds like you also understand. You're just kidding yourself if you think this is a myth. Even the Asian guy is this thread confirmed. 
seahawkguy,Sure there is: we're cheap, we drive bad, we keep plastic on furniture, we use things then return them for a refund, we study hard, we take our shoes off in the house, we gamble, we can take a joke, etc...

Cpalanz,K - that seems like an overly hostile view in my opinion but to each their own. The benefits of making the subreddit visible to locals who didn’t know it existed seem like they would outway petty unsubstantiated anger.

There is no good reason, other than some artificial automatic upvote bots, which we already know are used on this site to promote advertisements, for anything like this lame ass type of low effort content to have more than 5 points on a sub like this.

ThePelvicWoo,ISPs charging extra to access this site will lead to less users which will lead to less traffic which will lead to less ad revenue. 

There's a reason that companies like Reddit and Google are fighting so hard against this, and it isn't because of some moral high ground
bojasaurus_rex,Except there isn’t any evidence to suggest this will actually happen.
EngineEngineNo9,Except where ISPs have attempted to throttle down certain content in favor of their own?

Google it.  Just because you haven't seen the evidence doesn't mean there isn't any.
DingeR340,You're kidding, right? We don't need hypothetical situations; below are real life examples of companies breaking NN principals for monetary gain. These happened under the protection rules, imagine what would happen if we allowed the ISPs to run free...

MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&T: From 2007–2009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.

WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 

AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

AT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products. 

VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.
bojasaurus_rex,Sounds like a handful of incidents that have since been taken care of by existing measures. Don’t get me wrong, I’m for net neutrality. But there’s no “doomsday” scenario like Reddit would have us believe. IMO, it’s far more important that we keep the big companies from merging.
DingeR340,> taken care of by existing measures.

...that they want to remove. I agree most people are a little hyperbolic about it, but they will absolutely take away our freedom to choose what services we want to use on the net. The general lack of competition they face empowers them to do this so I wholeheartedly agree merges would make it even worse.

ThePelvicWoo,I think the big players with skin in the game know more about this than you or I. Google, Netflix, Reddit, Amazon, ect wouldn't be urging people to fight the FCC on this unless they fear an impact on their bottom line.
bojasaurus_rex,Why should we listen to them over the ISPs? I really not not think any of them have our best interest at heart.
ThePelvicWoo,That I agree with. They only care about themselves. I'm just stating that it's pretty clear that Reddit is pumping all of these posts to the front page because it supports their agenda 
bojasaurus_rex,Yeah, idk. Most redditors seem to sincerely be 100% all in with net neutrality.

timidforrestcreature,this is what happens when you vote republican
nat1127,Democrats accept lobby donations too and there are Democrats who have done the same thing as good ol Lindsey Graham. 

This is what happens when you vote without doing research. It’s not as black and white as we like to make it. It’s important to be an informed voter. There are Republicans that don’t act this way just like there are Democrats that do act this way. 
timidforrestcreature,democrats are overwhelming openly for net neutrality

republicans across the board want to dismantle it
NyanDerp,No, I'm a republican, and we hate him, too. He's a snake. The democratic party and republican party are both part of the problem, with the exception of a few people.
timidforrestcreature,democrats are overwhelmingly openly for net neutrality

republicans are across the board against it
NyanDerp,I just meant generally. I don't feel strongly about Net Neutrality either way. They're all part of the same swamp, and it doesn't help to turn against each other when we have a common enemy (creepy career-politicians with no clear policy, like good 'ol Lindsey, here.)

nat1127,Repost of my response to a similar statement made earlier:

See, to me I think it’s empowering to a degree. As a community we have the ability to make a difference and we have done so before. 

Imagine next election when other citizens are at the ballot box and think back to the post where their incumbent representative sold them out. If anything it at least makes a handful of people actually want to know what a candidate stands for so we don’t have this problem. 

It’s not Republican vs. Democrat, it’s being more informed as voters so schmucks like the ones spamming the front page won’t be in power anymore. 
None,[deleted]
nat1127,Shit...I never thought of it that way I assumed people would take this as a warning to become more informed in future elections...seems like you’re fucked if you do fucked if you don’t 
notcatbug,What's better, uninformed voters listening to corporate politicians and corporations and voting for where they pick, or listening to other citizens and following what the majority believe and support? If most voters are going to remain uninformed (and they probably will) I'd rather them listen to the masses and fellow citizens and not the rich billionaires who buy out the politicians. 
Dogmovedmyshoes,As long as the uninformed sheep are supporting the thing I like, there is not a problem, comrade.
Meowshi,Yeah, it isn't like ISPs have been caught throttling speeds for sites like Netflix in the past, or like one of the top major service providers removed their pledge to abstain from tiered internet the second it became obvious NN was going to be repealed.

_-BlueWaffleHouse-_,Exactly.  Reddit is using their platform for NN propaganda.  While I agree with the importance of NN it's also annoying if you've already done all you can do or live in a different country.  
Akasirus,Reddit made that post last week about how they’d do everything they could to support Net Neutrality. I guess this is their solution. 

😓
_-BlueWaffleHouse-_,I support NN and called my rep and sent emails.  This is too much and it makes me want to leave Reddit if it's just going to be a propaganda machine.  Yes this issue is important but maybe the next one won't be so good for us?

SirFriendlyFellow,I absolutely adore this movie, but dear god it has the worst sound mixing of any film I've ever seen my life.  Dialogue gets so quiet at times that you have to to turn it up insanely high just to understand what they're saying, which unless you turn it up and down throughout the movie, will deafen you later during the loud parts.  Still well worth the watch, but it's always bugged me in an otherwise amazing movie.
scobert,This is the first time I’ve ever heard anyone else mention this. I remember the first time I watched it, I missed a ton of stuff because I was so distracted by constantly adjusting the volume.  I was in a dark, quiet, echoey room — I either couldn’t hear what they were saying or I was getting my eardrums blown out.
huitcinq,I just watched this and turned on subtitles almost immediately

It's the kind of sound mixing that's super optimized for movie theatres where the home release is never really considered.
Alkein,While I didn't have an issue with this movie personally, I know thats a common complaint with a lot of Nolan movies, interstellar comes to mind as one I hear a lot of the same thing about as well.
wolfe_man,Nolan does this intentionally in his movies to make the audience pay more attention. It's not how I would do it, but the guy really knows how to make a movie so I deal with it

> Set in London in the 1800's, two rival magicians read each others diary containing the secrets of their magic tricks and personal life. As we go back in time when the diaries were written, both magicians become obsessed with their rival's best trick. The tricks, as shown to the audience, look the same, but neither magician can figure out how his opponent does it.

**Critical reception:**
> The Prestige received largely positive reviews from film critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 75% of critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average score of 7\.1\/10, based upon a sample of 190 reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 66, based on 36 reviews. Claudia Puig of USA Today described the film as "one of the most innovative, twisting, turning art films of the past decade." Drew McWeeny gave the film a glowing review, saying it demands repeat viewing, with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone agreeing. Richard Roeper and guest critic A.O. Scott gave the film a "two thumbs up" rating. Todd Gilchrist of IGN applauded the performances of Jackman and Bale whilst praising Nolan for making "this complex story as easily understandable and effective as he made the outwardly straightforward comic book adaptation (Batman Begins) dense and sophisticated... any truly great performance is almost as much showmanship as it is actual talent, and Nolan possesses both in spades." CNN.com and Village Voice film critic Tom Charity listed it amongst his best films of 2006\. Philip French of The Observer recommended the film, comparing the rivalry between the two main characters to that of Mozart and Salieri in the highly acclaimed Amadeus.

adriannlopez,Absolutely Nolan’s best film. He is a master of his craft, and every one of his films is worthy of praise and some criticism, but this film is perhaps one of the closest examples of what a human can describe as a perfect film. 

The writing, directing, and cast and performances are phenomenal, but what makes this film truly perfect is its use of audio and visuals to not only captivate you, interest you, and make you curious of the world you’re seeing but it also makes you believe the world and what you’re seeing is real, and that’s its prestige: you not only believe what you’re seeing, you believe it so much that it tricks you, plays with your mind and emotions, and suspends your disbelief when in fact you should be skeptical of everything you’re hearing and being shown. Not every film, or really any film, can do this with such precision. 

That’s why this film holds up so well to multiple viewings: most directors and writers set out to make one film, and sometimes barely accomplish that feat, but with The Prestige, what is it that Nolan set out to do, and what did he end up with? Is The Prestige one film or trick, or is it many? Is it infinite?

Ssutuanjoe,I really need to make a CMV post about this, because I really don't get the praise with this flick and would love to hear why people consider it so great.

Spoilers?

Wolverine and Batman are rivals. Wolverine travels by and far to find David Bowie, who's created a replicator machine. My first inclination of the replictor machine were the endless possibilities with it...but nope, Wolverine wants to make clones to do a trick to outdo Batman. All to reveal in the end that Batman has a Bat twin he's been using that Wolverine couldn't figure out.

Yes, I understand that Wolverine was so consumed with jealousy he didn't care about the other possibilities of the replicator...it just seems pretty underwhelming as a story.

Idk, any input would be appreciated. Or maybe this is just one of those movies that doesn't jive with me.
joeyJoJojrshabadoo3,Reddit loves all Nolan films while casting a critical eye on all other science fiction films.

All of Nolan's films ask us to take massive leaps of faith in logic. Like you can enter people's dreams while they sleep and mindfuck them! Tesla invented a machine that duplicates people! You can enter a wormhole and influence your daughter in the past with dust! And Redditors just accept this shit getting shoved down their throats, while getting on Star Trek for using a transporter during warp, or witnessing the destruction of Vulcan from a planet in another system, etc.
jonshado,Suspension of disbelief is required in all stories. The amount varies. Nothing Nolan asks for is too far, IMO. Just the way he wants to tell the story. 

You never know how the machine works in Inception. Just that it does. It's all that matters to tell the story. It's not hard science fiction because of that, I'd argue (in a different thread) but it makes the story they want to tell you better without the baggage of why.

But redditors bitching about star trek breaking rules that star trek made is not the same thing. That's just a poor writing choice or lack of detail. Which, I would contend, is legitimate to bitch about. As it would be for any story. 


bannana,>I really need to make a CMV post about this, because I really don't get the praise with this flick and would love to hear why people consider it so great.

I'm 100% with you on this, I don't get it. I can't get past the sub-par acting, funny fake accents, and blocky script to get to the 'good' part(s). I've tried to watch it at least three times and get to the half-way or 2/3 mark and am so completely fed up with the crappiness that any intrigue there might be is completely overshadowed by thoughts of my laundry. I've read most of these comments and just plain don't get it. 
ehehe,I feel the same. Have never been able to understand how people like this movie. I was really caught up in the story and expected a fantastic finish only be like... really? Cheap cop-out IMO, worse than "it was all a dream" and just left me completely disappointed. Literally anything would be better than the actual magic/sci-fi explanation. In a world with secret replicator technology, any magic trick is possible and the entire premise is just ridiculous. Shocking to see that more people aren't offended by how cheap/broken it is. Unforgivable. But I accept that I'm in the minority. I guess. 
Aruno,Doesn't Jive with me either. Feel the whole cloning bullshit took me out of the 'magic' of the film. Became suddenly Sci-Fi thriller flick which I really didn't like.
The_Church_Of_Kyle,I saw the movie long ago and don't remember David Bowie as Tesla, but probably mostly because I didn't know who Nikola Tesla was then.

I've been learning about him a lot lately, though, and the cloning machine makes a lot more sense if Tesla had any hand in it.

Tesla believed (knew?) that everything is electricity. He ran all kinds of experiments with electricity. This living dude, I forget his name - but you can YouTube "history and theory of electricity" to find him, they call him "Tesla 2.0", he believes that we can synthesize food with electricity. Like, take the building blocks of an apple pie and *zzzzp* you got yourself an apple pie.

In theory, it is not "science fiction" that there might be a cloning machine in the movie, but actually historically accurate in a way.

We can't synthesize food, and we likely don't have a cloning machine, but if either are ever a thing, you can bet your ass it will be because of Nikola Tesla!
Aruno,...Cloning machines not science fiction? The hell?
The_Church_Of_Kyle,Not according to Tesla, if I dare speak on his behalf.
Aruno,Really, never seen where Tesla suggested a cloning machine is even possible.
The_Church_Of_Kyle,I'm drawing conclusions for myself based on my recent studies.

Tesla studied electricity. He believed EVERYTHING is electricity. Him and those who study, similarly, live outside of the laws of physics. Not to say they can fly, but that they work with wildly different firmulas.

It is speculated that Tesla discovered a type of "free, unlimited energy", which this other guy (Tesla 2.0)  wasn't actually feasible, but then went on to talk about what it actually was (some type of monopole device).

Tesla is considered the greatest mind ever by the greatest minds ever, and the government stormed his place when he died and stole all his work. Who knows what he was actually working on or developing, but the lore surrounding him and his work strongly supports some super weird shit!
Aruno,So he never actually talked about cloning?
The_Church_Of_Kyle,Stop downvoting me just because you disagree, you bitch.
Aruno,Haven't down voted you once. Must be someone else.
The_Church_Of_Kyle,Well that someone else should do some research.

Eric Dollard, "Tesla 2.0". The interview he talks about synthesizing food.
SirMctrolington,I haven't seen the movie in several years but that is where it lost me too. Bale's character sent Jackman's character to Tesla as a misdirect but then it turns out that Tesla can, in fact, make a cloning device. It just completely removed me from the movie. It isn't so much about the turn into Sci-Fi for me as it just seems to completely invalidate the mind games and tricks of the 2 protagonists that lead to that point.
Spelaeus,The first act is The Pledge. You're shown something ordinary. Second act is The Turn, where it becomes extraordinary. The genre shift is very much intentional. 
Aruno,Well it intentionally ruined the rest of the movie for me.
e-luddite,Thank you! The praise in this thread was making me feel crazy, reading all of the spoiler notes to see if I missed something.

Ultimate 'big whup' movie for me.
-dillydallydolly-,I've heard this as a common critique of the movie and while I think it's perfectly valid, I also think that was kind of Nolan's point.

The trick, performed by Borden, is an actual illusion and mystifies us. It entertains us and we love it because we can't figure it out (until the end).

Angier's version supplied by Tesla is a scientific wizard tool that allows Angier to achieve the same thing but it feels cheap. It's too easy.

This all goes back to the movie's own dialogue about how the audience doesn't *really* want to know how the illusions work. We want to be fooled by the prestige. That's what makes this movie great for me, and allows me to overlook the shift in tone/genre.
dangerousdave2244,Also, there is no reason for Bale's character(s) to live a double life to such a crazy extent. Why would both twins spend time with one twin's wife, when she can tell that his personality has changed? Why not let her in on the secret, and have her only spend time with the twin she actually loves and who loves her, and let the other twin be happy with Scarlett Johansen, who doesn't necessarily have to be let in on the secret if they can't trust her? Or even if the wife doesn't know, why would the twin who has no feelings for her masquerade as his brother, her husband, for no reason, in private?
Yizashi,Spoiler: [That was the point of the scene with the old Asian magician scene. He lived his entire life acting feeble and weak so that no one would ever expect the obvious, that he just carried the heavy fish bowl with him. It was Bale's insane commitment to the illusion that lead Jackman to reject the obvious, and true, explanation that he used a double. Remember that Scarlet points out that both the man that goes in and the man that comes out were hiding missing fingers under their glove. Bale's commitment and attention to detail is part of what drove Jackman mad, around the world to eventually find real magic. If it ever came out, perhaps after a divorce or a fight with the wife, Bale would be ruined. As to why not just have the brother who lives her stay with her, that would mean the other brother would have to spend all his life of stage dressed up as a mute bearded weirdo. And it's clear from his affair with Scarlet that he wants at least half a life of his own which before she came along would mean time with the wife and kids.](/spoiler)

*Edited for formating
Human_Wizard,Oh, thank god. I'm reading through the comments here thinking to myself that the movie was boring. 
riptide81,The opening and closing narration of the movie describe the stages of a magic trick and the audience's willingness to be fooled. 

Wolverine's obsession blinds him to the fact that Batman's secret was really quite straight forward. 

So do you really believe you witnessed a man being cloned and teleported? 
Ssutuanjoe,Wait....so he wasn't cloned and teleported? Did wolverine have unlimited twins to murder? Did he not see David Bowie create a bunch of hats? 
riptide81,Well it's one of those eternal internet debates. The entire part about Tesla was in Wolverine's diary that Batman was reading in prison. 

The facts we have are that Wolverine was actually very wealthy, was gone for a long period of time and magic isn't real. 


Ssutuanjoe,Hmmm interesting. I'll need to watch again, I suppose...but if Wolverine forged a fake diary in order to leave as a red herring to mislead Batman, wouldn't that imply that he intended Batman to find it? I don't remember that implication in the movie.
riptide81,Well now we're past my positive memory of the movie and I need to rewatch it ,lol. 

I'm pretty sure "Lord Cordlow's" lawyer intentionally gave Batman the diary to read in prison. 
Ssutuanjoe,Interesting...I'll need to go back and watch it. Thanks! :)

McWaddle,I'm late to this, but hopefully my ramblings will end up being read by a few regardless.

I am going to go against the grain in this thread and say:

*There are no surprises in this film.*

Zero. None. Nothing is a surprise. There are a total of zero plot twists in this movie. But everyone thinks there are. 

*The whole fucking thing is a magic trick. An illusion.*

The first line of dialogue is the magician's question, which immediately misdirects the audience: "Are you watching closely?"

You're then misdirected through the whole film. Every single thing is laid out for the viewer; the viewer is shown every single piece of the puzzle, nothing is left out. But the viewer doesn't see it. The movie goes meta again, and explains it: *You want to be fooled.*

You're shown everything. But you don't want to see it. You want to be fooled.

This movie about magic tricks is a magic trick played on its audience. An illusion, misdirection. And it is stunning in its beauty. 

I first read here on reddit a year or so ago that every scene is a lesson on foreshadowing. I teach high school English, and foreshadowing is something I teach, so I paid attention. I watched it several times over. I showed it to my classes. Last December alone I watched it five times over the course of a week.

It is brilliant. It hides nothing. You are shown everything; the question is, do you want to see it?

No. You want to be fooled.

I'd love to explain everything I've caught in my multiple viewings, plus what my students have noticed. But I may run out of space, and it's late. A couple:

* Angier's wife dies by drowning in a magician's tank. Angier tries to replicate that by holding his head under water until he cannot take it any longer and surfaces, weeping. He later succeeds; he kills himself by drowning in a magician's tank again and again and again and again and again.

* Borden's wife dies by hanging. Fallon then dies by hanging.

* Angier fumbles killing Borden by shooting him. Borden then kills Angier by shooting him. Borden foreshadows this by explaining how dangerous the bullet catch is to his wife.

* It seems impossible to Angier that Borden doesn't know which which knot he tied. Between Borden and Fallon, Borden truthfully doesn't know.

* Sarah realizes there are two of them; sometimes he loves her, sometimes he does not. She figures out it's because there are two, and it destroys her. She screams during a fight with Fallon, *"I know what you are!"* She means that completely; she understands fully. She hangs herself.

* Fallon tells Olivia part of him (Borden) loved Sarah, but the part that is in front of Olivia right now (Fallon) loves her. She says he could be anywhere else right now and talking about her as he is about Sarah. She is being completely literal and is completely correct.

* "They are all your hat, Mr. Angier."

It's late and I could keep going, but I should stop. This is one of the best films ever made. I need to read the book.
espressoromance,Book is not as great unfortunately. I remember reading it and being underwhelmed. One of the few instances where the film is better than the book. (The other for me was Fight Club.)
liondadddy,Near the beginning when the boy sees the birdcage trick, he immediately comes to the (correct) conclusion that the bird has been killed. Everybody around him is satisfied when the bird's "brother" is brought out during the prestige. They wanted to be fooled. This whole sequence alludes to the idea of identical brothers being used in Borden's trick, but also to the sacrifices Angier makes during the final version of his own trick when the pledge is repeatedly killed.

Irene_Adler221B,I was so disappointed when I introduced this movie to an ex and they caught the twist within the first 30 minutes. Lol. 

I think this movie is seriously underrated. I just mean that in the sense that it seems like only movie people really know or appreciate it. 

*Edit bc words. 
AlwaysAngryyy,Twists are so interesting! The best ones happen when you could almost figure it out yourself but didn't quite connect all the pieces. Stray too far either way and the satisfaction just isn't there.

One of the reasons I've been trying to reduce my exposure to movies before I see them. The more you learn about a movie, the more time you have to uncover its twist before the reveal and spoil it for yourself. 
Irene_Adler221B,Totally!  Some really cool movie memories have been when I knew nothing about the film going in. 

This happened to me last year when I watched "Get Out."  Somehow I had no idea what it was actually about. It ended up being such a surprise and such a treat!

[>but Danton killed the originals of himself by drowning them. Meanwhile the other guy just had a twin from birth and they switched places.](/spoiler)
seancurry1,He wasn’t just a twin. 

He did the Tesla thing, but only did it once. The two just lived the same life. 
Schnidler,Wait what? 
constantvariables,That dude is wrong.  The Borden’s were legit natural born twins.  See the other comment on this chain.  
firexsam,Actually [Tesla lies at first that he used the machine to duplicate him so he can gain financing. Then he makes a real one. And the Borden journal was a forgery.](/spoiler)

[The twins had different first names. Alfred and Frederic. Hence the theme that it was too simple to believe he just had a twin. Its the part of the illusion. And Angier went too far.](/spoiler)

Its the same in the books and the film.

Deleos,[This is a spoiler]I dislike that part of the movie. How is it that Alfred/Frederic happened to send Angier to Tesla with a made up idea that he could be cloned, and then low and behold Tesla decides....sure I'll do that. (/spoiler)
ChristophColombo,Borden says nothing about Tesla creating copies of him. He implies that Tesla made a device that could physically transport him. That's why they thought the device wasn't working - they expected it to move the hat, not create a copy. 

And Tesla said he'd do it because he was broke and Angier was essentially offering him unlimited funds. So he was just going to BS and milk him for all he could get, but because he's Tesla, he also decides to actually give it a shot and comes up with something that actually works (sort of).
None,[deleted]
TheDavesIKnowIKnow,The big bold word "spoiler" is enough, no need.
ReferencesTheOffice,**SPOILER**

Wasn't there also the implication that he didn't know whether it would be him or the clone that came out the other side? So by the end of the movie, "Danton" could have been a clone of a clone of a clone. 
Deeger,[You're right, but the difference is just psychological for the character. It's not a "clone" as we know it, it's a fork that duplicates the life into two exact copies. One of them has to die. It's not a plot device, it's just characterization. He had to commit to dying for the machine to work. He had to get his hands dirty.](/spoiler)
joeyJoJojrshabadoo3,It was a flaw in his character. He could have done it once and just had an exact duplicate to do the trick over and over with and never use the magic machine again. But the character was flawed and had to have the prestige.
kirkt,Why did I never think of this?  Man I love discussions of this film.
joeyJoJojrshabadoo3,It kind of dulled me on the film though. Like first you have to get over the fact that David Bowie invented a matter duplication machine in the mountains of Colorado. Then you realize that this guy is creating clones of himself and murdering them/himself every night out of some bizarre character flaw. It's silly.
lolrpizzajeez,Well, no. How could he have Borden framed for murder if he didn't produce a corpse?
ReferencesTheOffice,Oh my god, I’d never even considered that. 
thedude37,That's because ~~it's not true.  [He showed us the kind of person he is the first time he cloned himself, and immediately shot his clone - he would rather kill the clone and be the only one with the secret.  That's the kind of magician he is - no one can know his secret, not even a copy of himself - he'd never be able to let the copy live (or conversely, the copy would destroy him).](/spoiler)~~ I didn't read OP's explanation very well and argued the same point I thought I was disagreeing with.  Derp.
Deeger,You're arguing the same point you're trying to disagree with. Angier's obsession led him to use the machine many times instead of just to obtain one copy.
thedude37,Damn... yes you're right.  I think I just glossed over the last line.  Fuckin hell.  I guess I wasn't watching closely :)
Deeger,I still learn something when I come to Prestige threads.
Nuranon,noticed Angier's blind stage helpers all looking the same?
Fyr5,I thought i saw everything! Thank you! I have another excuse to watch this film for the 11th time now!
LowVolt,Just realizing this from your post and it gave me goosebumps! This movie is so fantastic.

ginja_ninja,Only to everyone else...
Sand_Dargon,The difference starts when the clone appears and the other dies a painful death by drowning.
kingfisher6,It took me five or six times to catch the backhanded barb that Michael Caine gives to Jackman. Not only was he saying that he lied and the wife died painfully. But that Jackman essentially tortured himself every night for the show. 
Threepugs,Jackman already knows this though, as an early scene shows him at the tail end of attempting to drown himself (Or to understand what she went through) in a bathroom sink. It's hard to catch the implication, as it is part of a transition and only shows him pull his head out. It's right before the funeral scene.
mattstache,I actually just watched this recently and [no matter what, the original Danton dies. The first time he steps into the machine, he leaves a gun by the entrance of the machine. After creating a "clone", he shoots it (assuming the real Danton is the one still in the machine with the gun). Later on, when he performs the trick, he drowns the Danton that is in the machine. So, no matter what, the one in the machine has died at least once. The original Danton is no longer alive.](/spoiler)
Makorot,[This assumes that the machine acts always the same, It could be that sometimes the real thing gets transported and the clone is on the machine and the other way around](/spoiler)
OmniscientOctopode,[The scene where he first uses the machine implies very heavily that at least that time the real Danton was the transported one rather than the duplicate. We see it just after Borden tells Danton that it takes nothing to steal another man's work and Danton responds that it takes everything.](/spoiler)
Makorot,Fair Point
mattstache,[Even if it didn't always act the same, it wouldn't have worked one way the first time and never that way again. So the original is still dead.](/spoiler)
ixtlu,The hats. Where did all the hats come from? 
caspirinha,First time I watched it I just couldn't accept that this realist film had taken a sci-fi turn. I thought Tesla put them there to scam Hugh Jackman. Not keen on this film

Edit: forgot you're not allowed an opinion on reddit 
pewqokrsf,Agreed.
MedicineManfromWWII,Check out 'The Illusionist', released the same year. Also about a magician and magic tricks, but I think it's a better movie (most here will probably disagree with me) as the ending doesn't suddenly make the entire movie a different genre (science fiction).
caspirinha,Will do, thanks
sheguedep,Nah. I hated the "reveal". Detective just randomly works it altogether in his head at the last minute.
MedicineManfromWWII,Merely the fact that it COULD be worked out makes it a better ending than The Prestige.
sheguedep,Prestige ending blew my mind. And then rewatching it and seeing all the clues. 

Illusionist ending was just.. what.. that’s it... ok?
MedicineManfromWWII,Oh wow, they explained it all away with imaginary technology, brilliant!

powerwriting,An excellent movie. The ending was amazing; I loved seeing the full picture. 
Deeger,You're allowed an opinion. You're being downvoted because you had an errant conclusion that led your opinion.
SanderSRB,I don’t think the word *realist* means what you think it means when it comes to art and story-telling. 


SenoraObscura,*They're all your hat*
mg18,The machine kept making clones of the hat instead of transporting it. 
OmniscientOctopode,Or alternatively it did both. Transporting the hat and simultaneously creating a duplicate. Tesla is pretty adamant that he doesn't actually understand how the machine works.
mg18,Good idea too!

ECrispy,The Illusionist came out the same year. Not quite in the same league as The Prestige, but a great film in its own right. Its quite a coincidence, and since then we've only had garbage like 'Now you see me' which  barely even pretends to be about 'magic'.

Ranger0202,“I don’t need him to be my brother, I need him to be me!”

Easily my favorite Hugh Jackman movie. Absolutely kills it. 


  ======= 

script ====55
BrooSwane,I’ve always considered this film to be an allegory for Nolan’s career at this point: a conflict between a great showman, and a truly great artist that did something special with his craft. I.e., did Nolan want to be a guy that told incredible, unique stories like Memento, or a guy that made big superhero movies (B Begins was his film prior to the Prestige). Then he made Dark Knight which really did accomplish both. 

Alternating Batman movies with Prestige, Inception, and Interstellar really exemplifies this for me.

malcatrino,I really liked this movie when it came out and on subsequent dvd viewings. Recently picked up a Blu-ray of it and well, I didn’t really enjoy it that much. Don’t know why. Maybe it’s a bit too flash. 

The Illusionist however still holds up. 
LagWagon,I thought this movie was solid gold and The Illusionist was pure garbage. 
malcatrino,Virtually identical rating via Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. Prestige probably gets a lot more attention because it’s a Nolan joint. 
OceanicMeerkat,When I watch it now, it seems almost campy the way there are like 4 twists in the last 30 minutes of the movie. Big twists too.

To me, the plot twists feel crammed and it feels like the whole movie was made just to have those plot twists be in there. Like they came up with an ending and built a movie around it. It feels forced and contrived to me.

cmcrom,Super late to the party, but for anyone who has seen this a few times, I highly recommend the book! It is such a fantastic read, and the book ending had my heart pounding like few other books have done for me. The movie stays reasonably true to the book, with some minor things changed to make the movie flow easier, so it's easy to follow. But, the book frames the story in a way they didn't do in the movie, and it adds an engrossing new layer of rich story to get sucked into.

But seriously. I don't want to ruin the book ending for anyone. I can just say that it was one of the best book endings I had read in 2017.

i_shruted_it,I honestly wasn't shocked that a lot of people went to The Greatest Showman thinking it was another The Prestige.   They did a horrible job marketing the film IMO.  But if Reddit has taught me anything, it's that my opinion doesn't mean shit.
pizzasoxxx,This actually happened? From the trailer TGS looks like an absurd musical. The only similarity I see is wolverine.
i_shruted_it,Yes it happened.  It's definitely an original musical but it's not absurd.  Unless you can't stand musicals of course.  I thought it was fantastic.  Music is phenomenal.
pizzasoxxx,I only said that because I, yes, usually can’t stand musicals 😇

It looks like it’s so perfect for Wolverine though. That man is a one of a kind performer!
i_shruted_it,You will definitely hate it then.  Ive been a sound tech in musical theater for many years now so it was right up our alley (wife is a choreographer).  Hugh Jackman is a treasure.  He can go from the manliest role of Wolverine to dancing and singing pop show tunes.

S5thePupper,    

So here’s the deal. [Spoiler](/s "So the brothers [nolan] have mastered the transporting man trick. But because they killed Scarlett Johansson, Jackman wants to ruin them by ruining all their tricks. That’s pretty simple. But he is destroyed cause he can’t figure out the trick. So he drives himself to the brink of madness until he finds Tesla and they create clones. He thinks he’s won, but he’s killing himself. First by killing the clones. He thinks he’s won with Nolan in prison. But then comes the second way he kills himself. In his quest for the end of Nolan, he didn’t see the prestige that was pulled against him. He forgot himself and his magic roots, and he died for his folly. Meanwhile Nolan wins in the end by staying true to himself and his daughter. But the fight between jackman and Nolan has taken a toll even on Nolan, as the wife has killed herself just because Nolan wanted to continue a trick.")

Birch is renowned as a fast burner, especially the bark. If you enjoy the soothing ambience of a yule log but want a log that can keep up with your heavy-pour eggnog rum float, this is the log for you!

grubas,Birch bark is a pretty notorious fire starter.  If you find downed birch trees, especially white, you should strip them.

PlainTrain,He might have all his taps sunk into oak.
lubujackson,Oak syrup is a trash syrup!
PlainTrain,That’s just what Big Maple wants you to think.
DylanRCC,This comment reminds me of a character from the movie Best in Show. 
bobosuda,I'm Norwegian; we live in a big old farmhouse and our primary means of heating through the entire winter is wood. Birch is really the only thing we use, it works a lot better than almost any other wood (at least the ones that grow around here).
Higgilicious,Is it black birch? That's supposed to be phenomenal for a long, hot burn.
bobosuda,Black birch are not native to Europe. It's just regular European white birch we have here.
MoroseOverdose,Interesting, what are some other characteristics of burning other types of wood?
lubujackson,Hardwoods burn slow and long. If you'd like to have a fine table or a fine fire, use mahogany, oak or ash.

Pine is a trash wood and burns like shit because it has too much sap. That's what all those crackles are and the wood tends to split and burns unevenly.

Of course, if you are a true backwoods firebuilder you ignore all this and throw a bunch of crap in a bonfire out back and to hell with the implications! Painted wood for toxic fumes? Throw it on! Glossy magazines for more toxic fumes? Great for kindling! Half broken pallets with nails sticking out that could heat up and rocket out of the fire into your face? I'm already drunk!

Meeeeeerry Christmas!
ave0000,This guy bonfires.
jeaguilar,Pressure treated lumber left over from when the new deck got put up? Bring it.

spider_hugs,I came here just for the comments of wood burning properties. Because I saw the title and was like, "yeah, of course he used birch. What's he gonna do - burn some softwood garbage like pine?"
storm-bringer,Pine gets an unfair rep sometimes. The high sap content makes it ignite easily, and pine makes fantastic kindling, although it's not as good as cedar in that respect. It's true that pine is not very dense, and therefore doesn't burn for very long,  but it does burn hot. There isn't much point throwing pine into an already hot stove, but if you're staying a fire from nothing and want to heat your house up quickly,  a couple pieces of pine mixed in with some harder wood is jyst the ticket. 
thedogpawsaremuddy,Mentioning pine is like a conversational miners canary. The people who speak ill of it have either a very old stove, or just dont know what they are doing. Most of the homes in the northwest are heated with pine or fir and its quite nice to burn. The only valid complaint i can see is the lack of burn-time, having to reload the stove more frequently than a hardwood such as maple. 
storm-bringer,Yeah. I wouldn't want a firewood supply of 100% pine, but it is definitely part of a healthy mix. I probably have about 25% pine mixed in with fir, larch, and birch, and that suits me just fine.  
EatSleepJeep,Don't forget the pressure treated lumber for that bonus arsenic gas! 
Roscoe_p,Ash here burns hot and fairly fast. Normally mix it to get some of the Osage Orange or black locust to catch. That's for an outdoor stove with forced air though.
TransposingJons,This guy burns.  

Osage Orange is a true pro-tip.
mar10wright,I know a guy who turns wood. I went over to his shop and there were piles of the most vibrant yellow shavings.  Like so yellow they looked fake. Turns out it was Osage Orange. I had no idea it was that beautiful of a wood. 
Rubic13,Your comment had me interested into googling this tree. It's the tree with hedge apples!
Rainfly_X,I just wanna add Manzanita to the list. Technically it's a shrub, and it doesn't grow everywhere. The wood is dense and hard and smooth, so the ignition point is stupid high - you basically light a fire with something else, then use that entire fire to light the Manzanita. And people mostly do this to get rid of shrubs that they've chopped out of their yard.

Why go to all this trouble? Because it burns like uranium and butane. It's legendary hot. You can have a "small" fire that you can't get closer than ten feet from. There's something satisfying about that.
I_Molest_Pasta,Manzanita is super illegal to cut down without a permit where I am. Which sucks, some, since the wood is so fucking beautiful, but it's also cool because, it being so beautiful, I'm sure it would be gone before you knew it otherwise. 



Rainfly_X,Sorry to hear that, man. I would totally burn the fuck out of some manzanita in your honor, if I hadn't moved hundreds of miles away from my old home where it actually grew.
MoroseOverdose,That went from informative to white trash pretty quick, bravo

expert_sexchange,ugh more of the reddit circlejerk over how "bold" it is to just toss away one of the most cherished and well established aspects of the fireplace genre. without fail, reddit falls head over heels for ford's "lol so randum" choice of birchwood that just spits in the face of storied tradition.

meanwhile we have true masters who *respect the fireplace* getting ignored because their innovations aren't radical enough, like having a cat that wanders in and out of the frame periodically. get over yourself.

luhg89,This movie is very underated. I get drunk of Friday nights and look at Netflix for shitty movies to watch and make fun of with my wife. Ran across this one and had to re-watch the next day when I was sober. 
Lyratheflirt,I know I am 3 months late, but I just rewatched this movie after not seeing it for a few years. It's magical. I too came in with low expectations. I've seen a lot of shitty monster movies and expected this to be one of the same... but it wasn't. It was actually good. Like really damn good. Everyone I have shown this movie or recommended it to, loved it. Even my overly religious christian ~~friend~~ acquaintance loves the movie. My MOM loves the movie. I've seen it so many times and every time im grinning through out the whole thing. Is it the best movie ever? No. Is it MY best movie ever? fuck yeah I love Trollhunter.
expendableyouth,A friend and I in college did the same thing. We watched this as the second movie of the night and flipped our shit. We got together to rewatch it sober and it was still great. In the years since then, I've recommended it to any friend I have who likes horror movies. Only one has disliked it, but he genuinely enjoyed Jason X, so, you know, we don't take him too seriously.
Dabookadaniel,I dont trust people that enjoyed jason x
RazorRex,I enjoy Jason X.  Fite me.

lol.  No, I enjoy it like a bad movie.  Popcorn on, brain off.
AYDITH,Jason X pissed me off so bad holy shit. 
britishben,Jason X did have the head shattering with liquid nitrogen though, and the gag with him using a camper in a sleeping bag to beat another to death was pretty great. Overall though, it was not a good movie, but it's a good pick for bad movie night.
None,When this came out, a friend of mine was working at a movie theater.  We would get together "to make sure the cuts were done right" and watch the movie with all our friends.  We MST3000 the shit out of this movie, even had to vacuum the popcorn off the floor afterwards.  I loved this movie, for all the wrong reasons.

script ====5
nugfuts,I normally hate found-footage movies or whatever that style is called. But I liked Trollhunter quite a lot. One thing that surprised me was that I expected the budget to be way too low for any extended CGI or special effects, meaning we'd only glimpse of the trolls (if that). But no, it showed them in detail. That doesn't "make" a movie, I know. But it added to the quality I thought.
Smart_in_his_face,CGI is slightly easier if all the shots are in dark or dim light.

It makes sense since trolls turn to stone in daylight, but it also means all the trolls are viewed in the dark, and CGI is easier in the dark.
grshealy,did you watch the movie? [hover for spoiler](/spoiler "the end was nearly daylight")
RazorRex,> and CGI is easier in the dark.

LOL This sounds lewd or devious.  

BillyBattsShinebox,I haven't seen the film since it was released, so maybe I'll think differently now, but I honestly thought that they looked great too.  They had some great designs.
Lyratheflirt,I just watched it today, it holds up well. It's still dated, and very noticeably cgi, but something about it... just works.
siirka,Relatively simple yet intimidating as hell. 
bobosuda,The cool thing is that most of the designs for the trolls are taken straight out of Norwegian folk-lore. They just CGI'ed the old classic fairy tale drawings of trolls.
txslam,Umm... didn't you read the beginning,  this footage was unaltered... so there's that

Twokindsofpeople,There are some really big bridges.
BackOfTheHearse,Trolls aren't Gnomes. 
VileStench,Trolls are pretty big. 
Natdaprat,For you. 
kinkysnowman,In norwegian folk-lore trolls are pretty much mountains.
Professor_Hoover,The mountains are also trolls. Legends about trolls pass say the mountains are covered with stone trolls who didn't quite get away before the sun rose.
BJHanssen,Troll tales are narrative maps. If you know the story of the mountains you see along the coast, you can tell where you are just by looking around you :)
Professor_Hoover,That's really cool. My tour guide also told us about the female trolls with tails who would kidnap men and keep them as slaves then return them when they got bored with no memories of the trip. I'd love to go back to Norway someday.

  ======= 

script ====28
FixBayonetsLads,It has its ridiculous moments, like how trolls can apparently "smell Christianity."
Feministenschranze,The entire movie is metal as fuck. The part in the [cave where the Christian guy starts praying only to get told to shut the fuck up](/spoiler) is hysterically funny.
anglicizing,It's a common theme in the fairy tales that gave birth to the concept of norwegian trolls, that they smell the blood of Christian men. [Here is one example](https://www.worldoftales.com/European_folktales/Norwegian_folktale_13.html).
FixBayonetsLads,Yeah, no, I'm aware of that. It just bugs me that they try to make the trolls out to be just natural creatures, with eating and breeding habits, and territories, and then oh yeah also they can smell Christians. The movie is filmed in such a way that it's almost like a nature documentary, and that one fairy tale aspect is just super jarring to me. But I guess that's not a valid criticism since I'm getting downvoted to hell. 
Quinnel,Trolls in the folklore were hunted nearly to extinction if I recall correctly. The reason they can smell "christian blood" isn't inherently some biological thing either, because trolls *also* live to be like a thousand years old or more.

Meaning the trolls that hate Christians are the same ones that would have been hunted on the Medieval period, according to the folklore, which I find inherently interesting.
AlpacaDraco,Thats a nod to norway fairytales about trolls
FixBayonetsLads,It's still ridiculous though, especially since the rest of the movie takes great pains to make the trolls as realistic as possible(aside from the stone thing)
absintjente,Tell that to the medieval Norwegians

UlyssesThirtyOne,No, it is. 
zigaliciousone,I think it's one of my favorite foriegn films of the last few years.  Definitely impressive considering their budget.

ZionsEdge,I watch this movie about once a month...for me it's definitely a hidden gem
SixMileDrive,It's great **for what it is**. It's a low budget foreign found footage film where a bunch of college kids find trolls in the wilderness during a school trip.

This movie should **suck**.

Instead, it's surprisingly funny and entertaining. I enjoyed it. It's not going to win an Oscar, I won't watch it again, but I would recommend it to a friend to watch when they have some time to kill.
Blakk420,A lot of people enjoyed this movie. As most have said, you have to go in with pretty much no expectations and 95 minutes to spare. I myself turned it on one rainy afternoon after flipping through channels and see a movie called Trollhunter.   

It's not an extravagant movie with lots of CG and movie star hot actors. It's found footage style and seems so damn realistic you would swear it was real.  

And don't get me started about the Main Character.

Moodfoo,Anno 2017 a movie named Trollhunter would be more likely to be a geopolitical thriller involving cyberwarfare than one about monsters.
None,Hence the southpark episode arch and references to this movie and Scandinavian folk lore.  The one thing the Danish can do is to get a troll out of its cave.  
FatPinkMasts,The Danish have nothing to do with troll folklore, that comes from the norwegian landscapes and farmers. Denmark is basically a flat field

TheRunescaper,Just wanted to chime in. If you haven't seen this yet and are somehow reading this, know this: THIS MOVIE SUCKS. IT BLOWS. DO NOT WASTE AN HOUR AND A HALF OF YOUR TIME. 

The good: the scenery, the actors, the quality of the visuals.

The bad: EVERYTHING ELSE. Pressuring the audience into thinking trolls are real and that this actually happaned was dumb AS SHIT and the WHOLE POINT OF THE FILM.

Seriously fuck this film and fuck all you redditors that thought this piece of shit was good.

Ps. With all do respect it's actually a decent film on its own, but all you redditors hyped it up as being a good film on netflix and shit when IT IS NOT!!!!
-4-a-,So you're saying that this movie was bad because it is about trolls, which don't exist? You know the existence of the fantasy genre right? 
TheRunescaper,honestly all things considered it was a good film (indie, low budget, developed from traditional folklore/fairy tales) but i certainly did not enjoy it and furthermore i do not think it should be this highly upvoted since people like me often do not have the time or interest too watch many films 
-4-a-,Well, using caps lock and multiple apostrophes is one way to get downvoted, so is personally insulting people who like something. You should've written this instead.
TheRunescaper,aside from the film, personally i don't care about getting downvoted. i know a lot of people won't agree with me or the things i say. i don't care about whether people like it or not but at the very least it should be out there.

and i was simply trying to point out that as someone who watched the film, i personally did not enjoy it. my bf did not enjoy it. people have a right to know and express that.

> When bears are found dead in Norway, students from Volda University, Thomas, Johanna and cameraman Kalle, decide to investigate. They stalk the trail of the mysterious hunter Hans expecting to find an explanation for the killings. The reluctant Hans tries to flee from the youngsters, but then agrees to let them film him in action, provided they follow his orders. Soon the trio of students learns that Hans is actually a troll hunter working for a secret government agency. Further, several dangerous trolls have escaped from their territory and Hans is assigned to eliminate them.

faithle55,Troll*jegeren*.

Same word - or similar - as German Jaeger.

Interesting.
Born_in_the_purple,Norwegian is originally a germanic language so it's not a coincidence. :)
Lexinoz,Norwegian and German share language ancestry. A lot of words are similar or even directly the  same. Look it up. It's actually pretty interesting a subject.

PequenaNeko,Not to be mistaken with Trollhunters the animated series written by Guillermo del Toro...which isn’t half bad too. 
BlankCanvasTX,I love him. I’ll have to check it out.
ninjawarts,R*ea*lly? Huh, I guess I never looked at it well, because I just assumed that it was just another generic Dreamworks Netflix kids show. Neat.
devesh741,I loved this series, fantastic animation, incredible action and a surprisingly good story. Kelsey Grammar is easily the funniest thing in it. Guillermo del Toro has a whole trilogy planned in the same universe. 
Lexinoz,Season two just recently came out and lives up to it. But since the main voice actor (Anton Yelchin) died, they are uncertain of how a third season is going to be done out of respect. They also delayed S2 because of that. 
FourthOf5,I read one interview where del Toro said they had enough of Yelchin's work left to properly do most of season 2, and that there is a point in the story where his character could understandably experience some vocal changes. 
None,[deleted]
Arclite83,Yelchin apparently had a ton of the voice work already done when he died. So that helped. But he has a very distinct voice so it's going to be hard to replace him, whatever they do.

shinslap,I wouldn't exactly call it an independent movie. Filmkameratene is a pretty but studio (by Norwegian standards at least) and this movie, like most others in Norway, get government subsidies.

Downvoted_Defender,Of all the "found footage" style faux-amateur films, this one was by far the worst. It was not scary, it was not well made, and the CGI trolls looked laughably bad. I'm struggling to think of a similar style film that's worse, but I can't.

This could almost be a children's film in the spirit of Where the wild things are, but it is totally devoid of any semblance of theme or message. There are no redeeming qualities in this film. Don't waste your time with this.
a_fookin_T-Rex,Also, it is sooo booooring.
eaglespider,Yeah reddit really seemed to praise this movie and I just don’t know why. I even forced myself to watch it the whole way through and it never moved up to the hype.
Soulwindow,It's not meant to be scary, mate. It's a comedy using Scandinavian folklore.
  
The CG wasn't that bad, it could be like the Bayformers and be a total shitfest.
  
This is honestly one of the better "found footage" movies, because it's a parody of the genre, a spoof, satire making fun of people who believe in trolls.
imperialismus,Yes. I always see it described as a horror film which it definitely isn't. It wasn't intended to be a foreign cult hit so the creators didn't pander to an international audience. It's a comedy that plays on local culture. If you go in not understanding the context and expecting something else, you'll be disappointed.

Although I would disagree that it's making fun of people who believe in trolls, because nobody believes in trolls. It's more making fun of government bureaucracy, and having fun with transplanting old fairy tales into a multiethnic, secular modern-day society, which is a lot more fun if you actually know the source material.
Soulwindow,As a kid I always used to watch those stop motion videos on HBO, the ones that always stuck out to me were the story of Persephone and the old troll stories. So coming into this I already knew about troll lore, so it was a fun ride.

jimmahdean,It's crazy, I saw this movie for the first time a year or so ago and there's a song that takes soundbytes from it (specifically "The essential components of a death machine!" and one of the screams) but I can't find the song anymore now that I know where it's from :|

Pretty sure it's by God Module but I'm questioning that now.

Great movie, btw.

jimmahdean,Nah, it's this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTN2Rt_ipCQ

It's not on spotify and it's a pretty unpopular song so it makes sense why I couldn't find it.

SKTisBAEist,The Cube is one of the first horror movies that legitimately made me go "What the actual fuck is going on here?"

It's not necessarily scary (beyond some jumpy death scenes), but it makes up for that and then some by being a tense psychological thriller from start to finish. You actually care about the characters, when they die, and why they've ended up in inside this strange place. Will always recommend.

Fievel_Petrie,But how is cube 2: hypercube? Cubier than the first?
Spektr44,I enjoyed Cube 2, but it wasn't as good as the first. The cube of the first movie seemed like something that could actually be constructed, however unlikely. The cube of the second movie messed with the laws of physics and required much more effort to suspend disbelief.
nat2r,Cube 2 is pretty damn good, and Cube Zero is also a fun watch as well.
War_Daddy,There's a ton of hate for it ITT, but I think some people are just parroting the early opinion. 

It's the only one I ever saw,  and I liked it a lot.  Some of the execution is bad,  but the concept is so good it carries the film

Smurfman254,Random (semi related) Story Time

When I was young I had this nightmare where my entire family got put into that heart from [pajama sam 3](https://i.imgur.com/TFXjhfl.png) ([Inside for reference](https://i.imgur.com/UwvqpET.png)). There were 100 rooms in the heart and everyone started in a different room. Every 10 minutes the rooms would shut, everyone not in a room died, and everyone in a randomly selected room would die. Then all the rooms except the randomly selected room opened again and the process would start over but with 99 rooms. The game proceeded until there was one room remaining at which point the survivors would be freed. I don't know what lethal combination of 4 corners and Pajama Sam I had that day but I definitely didn't play Pajama Sam for months.

baconwiches,Ugh, ezri dax
mag-neato,I haven't finished DS9 yet, but I fully reject the idea of a new Dax.
baconwiches,I won't spoil it for you, but that's the correct opinion
mag-neato,It has unfortunately already been spoiled for me, but I appreciate the sentiment. I don't know details, but I know generally what happens. Basically why I haven't finished it yet, Jadzia is my favorite character.
baconwiches,The series is still very much worth finishing. They finish off the overaching storyline well, and a few of the episodes are brilliant. Garak, Dukat and Damar all get interesting stuff to work with, and nail it. The finale is I think 8 parts, which was insane for its day, but it has aged well. Ezri even has a few good moments. I wish they'd gone the polar opposite with her; put the symbiote in a meek man instead of another confident woman. However, there a few times when the Ezri character was excellent... it's just that 90% of the time she just made you want Jadzia instead.
mag-neato,I agree that they should have made the new Dax more different, but I feel there may not have been room in the story for an even heavier Dax/Worf shift. I'm having some dental issues lately and just laying around the house while I'm not at work, so now would be a good time to go ahead and finish it. My boyfriend will definitely be excited for that, he's been trying to get me to the end of this series for a few years lol

VAJAYNUS,Bad bot.

The Movie is Canadian, so where is it pulling "USA" from?

MudAnimal,Not sure if this counts as a spoiler since I don't remember if it's from this movie. Does anyone know if one of the death scenes is due to super sonic sound waves? I can't remember if this is the movie where a guy explodes from the sound.
eat-KFC-all-day,This happens in the Cube 0, the prequel.
None,[deleted]
whoizz,It was for sure the prequel. Just watched it last night. (Cube: Zero)
travvo,Not in this one. I haven't seen any of the sequels, but have seen this one many times.

wait... how can sound travel faster than the speed of sound?

script ====46
ATAGChozo,The sequel, Cube 2: Hypercube, has to be the only horror movie in existence to incorporate theoretical mathematics as one of it's core concepts and themes. That one had too much bad cgi though, and the very low budget shows.


  ======= 

script ====47
GingerAvenger543,As someone who still bears mental scars from watching the opening scene of Saw 5 in my childhood, would this be an ok movie to try to ease my way into the horror genre? I enjoy the thrill of horror stuff like a normal person, it’s just that the post-watching fear and paranoia effects last a long time. 
If not, is there something better (preferably on Netflix) I could try?
liamemsa,I haven't seen the later Saws, but I'm pretty sure they're all just torture porn.

This movie has *one* "graphic" scene and it's 30 seconds in. The rest of the film is just psychological horror. There are a few deaths, mild gore, but that's it. Absolutely nothing like what you'd see in the Saw films.
Blimey85,This isn’t bloody or gross. I wouldn’t even call it Horror. It’s more... sci-fi maybe? It’s more of a drama. However you label it, it’s a great movie. 
GingerAvenger543,That’s good to hear, I’ll definitely check it out then
GingerAvenger543,(Spoiler warning if someone is somehow still browsing this thread) Just watched it, definitely a great movie. A little confused as to how Leaven didn’t hear Quentin open the door at the very end, but other than that I enjoyed it. Not much of a horror, like you said
Blimey85,Glad you liked it. It’s been a long while since I had last watched it. Added it to my list on Netflix yesterday and am planning to rewatch soon. There’s also sequels that some really like and some think are crap. I liked them myself.

That may have been the word I was looking for. I'm just happy some people were able to see it for the first time via this thread!

gtwilliamswashu,Yes! So glad this is available! I believe the budget for this film was very low and they reused a lot of the scenery. I mean... lots of cube scenes. Haha. Can't wait to re-watch this and be shocked at what I thought was high quality graphics in middle school.

uzimonkey,Underrated?  You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it means.  Every single time I've ever heard Cube mentioned it's in the context of "awesome movie."  Cube is in no way underrated.

I haven't seen it in a looooooong time though, I might give it a watch.

Maximelene,If you liked this movie, try playing the board game Room 25. It's basically "Cube: the game", and it's amazing. Playing it with 8 players (2 of which are traitors) made some of our best gaming nights.

phD_in_Random,this movie is terrible but also pretty good. The acting is bad, the dialog is bad, the characters aren't believable but it's still a fun movie. Paranoid Conspiracy Doctor says they're making widgets in my town (Saskatoon) that helps people rule the world so that's a plus.

waiting_is,Is it chilling and suspenseful, or gruesome and gnarly?
factualbarnmonarchy,Definitely both. 
leadchipmunk,Yes. There's some suspense and mindfuckery going on and some gore. Additionally, there aren't any jump scares. It's an all-around good horror(ish) movie, and this is coming from somebody who doesn't particularly care for horror.
waiting_is,Thanks for replying! I love being unnerved, but have no time for gore.
mrjackspade,Theres a bit of gore, but its horror movie level appropriate. 

Its definitely NOT murder porn
leadchipmunk,There are really only two gory scenes, and they aren't *too* bad. This is a low budget film, after all. You can always check the IMDb parental guide for the film to see more info. It isn't too spoilery.

jokala9,I'm under 18, can I still make the call and have it count? 
The-Magic-Sword,Yup, they still represent you and on top of that, you can let them know you never intend to vote for anyone who is against net neutrality, you'll have the right to vote in the future after all, you'll be giving them an idea about what side of history they need to be on.
Toastinggoodness,You absolutely can make the call. U are still a valued citizen of our great democracy who will (hopefully) vote once old enough. 
crushendo,Totally!
Dyl000,Seeing as you’re just telling them of the fact that you are in favor of net neutrality and it isn’t a form of voting then I wouldn’t see why not 
aofhaocv,Of course! You could probably even say "I'm not voting for you if you do this," if you wanted to be a bit cheeky - since of course it's true anyway.
Keltin,So, in case you saw the other guy's attempts at gatekeeping/suppression, *yes*, you can absolutely contact your representatives. Just because you're not of voting age yet doesn't mean they don't represent you. If they *do* try to pull crap like that, find some time they used a "think of the children!" argument. Children are their constituents too. *You're* their constituent.

Also, don't listen to anyone who tries to tell you that you need to be an *expert* to have an opinion. Be informed, but that doesn't (usually) mean go find academic papers.

None,Ajit Pai, FCC Chairman: 1-202-418-1000
 
You need to contact your representatives and senators about Net Neutrality even if they already support it, but especially if they don't. 

Remember that this very thread is only possible because of a free and open internet; kill net neutralityand threads like this might be a thing of the past.

Easy way: 

Step 1: Go to BattleForTheNet.com.

Step 2: Do what BattleForTheNet.com tells you to do. 


The harder, but still very easy way:

Step 1: Find out who your Representative and Senator is/are. 

Find your Representative.

Find your Senator.

Local elected officials.

Step 2: Find your Representative and Senator's contact information. 

5calls.org has a decent repository of Representatives and Senators contact information, though the site is a bit difficult to navigate.

Call My Congress just asks for your zip code and tells you what district you live in, who your Representatives are, and how to contact them.

DailyKos has a list of all of our Senator's phone numbers, not just the DC office. (Current as of February, 2017.)

FaxZero has a system set up allowing you to fax your Representatives and Senators for free! (Faxes are 
good if you can't get through on the phone lines, or just if you want congressional staffers to listen to fax machine noises until Net Neutrality is safe.) 

Fax Congress

Fax Senators

Step 3: Call, write, or fax to express your feelings on this. 

A lot of people are nervous about calling their elected officials for the first time, maybe you don't know what to say, or how to say it, or even who you'll be talking to, so here's what you'll need to know. 

There's a 75% chance your call will be answered by a Secretary who is specifically there to listen to your concerns, there's a 25% chance your call will be bumped into a voicemail box which is specifically there to listen to your concerns, there is a ~0% chance you'll find yourself on the phone with your Senator or Representative. 

You may be asked for your name and address or zip code, it's okay not to tell them if you don't want to, but the information is useful for your elected officials. I usually just give my first name, zip code, and the name of my town. 

Don't worry about a script, don't worry about being eloquent, you're not writing Shakespeare here, you're a concerned citizen voicing their frustrations, fears, and hopes. "I'm really scared of Ajit Pai's plans to roll back net neutrality, a free and open internet is important to me because [Your reason here. Some suggestions: An open internet is important to democracy/I worry what Donald Trump might do with more power/Cable bills are already too high/etc.]. Please tell [Senator or Representative] that I support a free and open internet, I support Net Neutrality, and I vote." The only hard and fast rule is that you need to be polite; these folks are getting dozens, if not hundreds of calls a day, they don't need you bitching and swearing at them for something they have no control over. Be passionate, but be polite. 

Reminder: Only call YOUR OWN elected officials! Calling Mitch McConnell from sunny Florida won't do anyone any good, and might actually harm the cause. Only call your own elected officials, period.

They *know* it’s a money grab, and it doesn’t matter what the little people do.

Our government is a broken, pathetic shell of the ideals it stood for. This is just a symptom of the greater sickness the country is suffering.

At this point, I feel less obliged to honor this country than I do obligated to abandon it as soon as possible.
The-Magic-Sword,If it continues to be controversial and we keep raising awareness the issue will eventually become acute enough to be enshrined as legislation in congress under the right political circumstances, there is an endgame here.

PopePC,Somebody please fill me in.  Why would they want to kill net neutrality?  Isn't it an obviously good idea to have it around?  Removing it would just makes it easier for big companies to screw the populace over.  Who *doesn't* wants net neutrality? Not lobbyists or companies, but people?  Because a representative's job is not to represent their lobbyists, but rather to represent their constituents.  Anything else is a perversion of Democracy.  Can money really buy power here?
sovelsataask,Of course money can buy power. Money can always buy power.
Dasmage,It's obviously good for us, normal joe soe internet user, but it's not good for any corporations profits that's in the telecommunication game.  They want to be able to label traffic that comes across their system however they want, not to really deny you that traffic but to either make you pay more to have that traffic come to you over there system at a reasonable speed or to make the content provider pay more to send the traffic to you at a reasonable speed( most likely both will happen).
ArcaneArceus23,That would also be unconstitutional though. Pay to have free speech, censoring free speech and free press, from what I understand, that’s against the 1st amendment.
dawnraider00,But why would any person want that? The comment above yours explicitly stated they did not mean companies

the_fathead44,*A link to the DC FCC Protest subreddit, as well as a link to the Net Neutrality video from earlier today has been added below.  Additionally, it looks like people are starting to organize protests!  I have included link to the Verizon protests below as well.*

&nbsp;

We know the fight for Net Neutrality is getting real, and the next few weeks are going to be tough. People have been making post after post, raising awareness, and encouraging people to write or call their congressman, support this or that movement, tweet... It's always about the written and verbal effort, but no real information about how we can physical organize to make a stand.

**~~So my question is this, are there any real, major planned protests to fight for Net Neutrality?~~ We are finally starting to organize!**  I'm not talking about a hundred people here, or a thousand angry people there, but tens to hundreds of thousands of people across the country, willing to get out and take a legitimate stand for one of our actual freedoms. *If we lose this fight, we'll also lose those written and verbal outlets to take a stand and defend our other freedoms. If one falls, they all fall.*

A large scale, country-wide, physical protest is one of our greatest weapons against those people who can turn a blind eye or just straight up ignore our written and verbal pleas.

Please, we need to organize something before it's too late. We need someone, or groups of people who are willing to put something together in their local areas. We need people who are willing to organize and march on DC.

There's a reason why the FCC and Congress waited for this week to make their announcements about their schedule and plans to kill Net Neutrality. They're scared. They want to make it inconvenient for us to stay informed and act. They want us to be traveling, focused on the holidays, black Friday, online shopping deals... They want to use the colder weather against us. They know people are taking vacation days for Thanksgiving and will likely be limited in taking time off after Thanksgiving as they save money and prepare for Christmas. The writing is on the wall. They're doing everything they can to limit us to just the written and verbal efforts, because once they win, they can crush those efforts as well.

The greatest way for our fight to gain momentum is to create and maintain a physical presence. We need to get organized, it needs to be big, and if need to be loud.

Please, if you know of any planned protests, share that information below. If you want to become an organizer, share that as well. Create Facebook groups and invite everyone, make posts about it in the various subreddits you're a part of to get more people active.  Check to see if your town/city has it's own Subreddit, or maybe even a Discord, and start communicating and coordinating with others on there.  Everyone can pitch in and make a difference here, and we're going to need all the support we can get.

&nbsp;

**I'll go back and edit all of my posts and comments to add all of the information I receive to help increase its visibility. We need to act, and we need to act fast.**

Edit:  Here's a subreddit to start organizing - https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_FCC_Protest/

Also, [here's the link to video about Net Neutrality that hit the top of r/all before being removed by the mods of r/videos only to be replaced by a Megathread.  Please consider adding this video to your comments to help keep it circulating!](https://youtu.be/UsyzP5hejxI)

The_Apex_Predditor,FYI Congress and the Senate have nothing to do with this. Only five people at the FCC get to vote.
  
[Here they are](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership). The three men plan to vote to repeal net neutrality. The two women plan to vote to keep net neutrality. 
  
Their individual contact information can be found under "Bio".  
  
To defeat the net neutrality repeal, one of those three men has to change their vote. 

Be wary of any schemes like call x number or text to y for an automated message, I’ve been seeing those posted around a lot lately. They’re reminiscent of the text xxxxxx to vote for Hillary scam in 2016.

Keltin,Let's not act like the majority of Americans want this. We don't. Not even a majority of those who voted even voted for Trump, but our system is weird and archaic so here we are. 

But the FACT/Comcast/etc is trying to pull this off against the wishes of the *majority* of Americans. We don't want this. Even most Trump voters probably don't want this. This is corruption, plain and simple. And as a voter in an extremely blue district in a blue state with a rep and senators who were never going to support this anyway, I'm not sure how much my voice even matters. Because it's gotten to the point where if you don't live in a swing state, you just get ignored. You'll vote the same way in either case.
dawnraider00,No point in dividing it along partisan lines. *Americans* don't want it, regardless of political affiliation. Whether you're left or right, this *will* negatively affect you, and your voice always counts. Because even if your particular voice doesn't change one particular person's mind, you're part of a movement with a big voice. The more people that support net neutrality, the bigger the group's influence is.

Christofiel,Except that net neutrality is really just a harmful regulation that gets in the way of the free market and fair commerce. It prevents content creators and streamers like Netflix from being able to gain access to the extra bandwidth they need to connect their users with the content they (we) want quickly because we paid our hard-earned money for it. Somewhere along the line, someone payed for EVERYTHING. That’s how real life works. 

EDIT: I have more thoughts. 
If you really want to do something about all of this, then let your money be your vote and boycott ISPs who censor things if that’s what you’re worried about. Fun fact: there are multiple of them. You can choose. It’s the economy, stupid. 

TL;DR: free market good. Net Neutrality bad. 
Chair_Aznable,The problem with what you are saying is that here in America ISP's hold regional monopolies. You get one maybe two choices. They don't have to compete because we don't have a choice, we either deal with their terrible business practices or don't use the internet.

If we could break up the monopolies NN wouldn't be needed because ISP's would have to compete. Until then NN is our best safeguard.
ninjattorney,This is untrue. ISPs don’t get a “regional monopoly”. In fact, two weeks ago I switched from ATT to Charter to get a better rate.

Now, I don’t doubt that there are some difficult to serve areas where only one ISP has invested in infrastructure there, but that isn’t a “regional monopoly”. That’s basic economics.
Chair_Aznable,That is your experience though. In alot of places in the US you get one, maybe two choices that are both less than steller.
ninjattorney,Right, but what you originally said was that "here in America ISP's hold regional monopolies". That is a demonstrably untrue statement, and I offered my own experience to demonstrate its falsity.

I totally agree with what you just said about there being lots of places that don't have multiple great options. We probably disagree about the causes and solutions regarding that problem, but it is still a true statement. My disagreement was with how your original statement was a blanket assertion about the situation here in the US.

HalLogan,So what you're saying is, you don't like an entity that's not under your control sticking its nose in your web content? That's kind of the point.

Seriously, talk to anyone who has the word "network" in their job title and who doesn't work for an ISP. It's a big deal. Or just head over to battleforthe.net, make a few phone calls, and tell people like me to shut up because you called your Congress critters already.
WeepingAngelTears,Except you literally are signing a contract with the ISP to use their property to access the internet. Don't like it? Cancel your contract. 
HalLogan,All things being equal, I'd agree with this argument. However all things are not equal - the cable companies have networks that they built with the revenue they pulled in via years of government-gifted monopolies. Verizon and AT&T likewise got no small amount of public help in running their networks. 

More importantly, those same ISP's actively lobby against efforts to enable municipal broadband to compete with them. Don't believe me? Try setting up a wireless network for your neighborhood - just issue a press release and watch how quickly you get C&D letters.

If there was truly open competition then normal free market rules would apply. But there isn't, so they don't. 
WeepingAngelTears,The reason there isn't a free market in ISPs is because of government regulation. 
Chair_Aznable,No, its because the ISP's have regional monopolies and don't have to compete.
WeepingAngelTears,They have regional monopolies because of government interference.
Chair_Aznable,I hate to tell you. Getting rid of those monopolies is going to take government interference. The ISPs aren't gonna be like "oh you got rid of NN, guess we'll break ourselves up and stop being dicks now".

Net Neutrality is our only current safeguard given the ISP's have monopolies. You want to get rid of regulations? Better start finding ways to break up those monopolies because getting rid of the only protections we have is just going to give them more room to keep screwing the consumer.
Cubanmonkey1,Jesus, did you read any of the comments? Government is the reason these monopolies were created in the first place and your first solution is more government and regulations. Lmao. The internet wasn't broken in 2015 why try to fix something that is not broken? What needs to happen is for local townships to lift regulations on start up ISP's and encourage them to enter the area. Stop accepting lobbying ISP's for regional control by helping them pass laws that restrict smaller ISP's. As for NN the tier 3 ISP's are in the best position to practice QoS. If you know what that means. A lot of people, politicians, journalists, regular folk are talking about something they know nothing about. It's hilarious and sad. I'm pretty sure most politicians went to school for LAW, not hardware engineering. They shouldn't stick their nose in something they can't comprehend.
Chair_Aznable,My last reply was three weeks ago. 

But if we are gonna beat this dead horse some more fine. Starting an ISP is hard. The barrier to entry is high because laying down cable is fucking expensive and the ISPs are not gonna let go without a fight. They have and will spend money getting the law changed in their favor, sue companies and states, or just spend money on spreading misinformation. I've seen alot of these in areas that have tried to implement municipal broadband.

Basically it's a massive uphill battle, and good luck getting really anywhere. We have no way to really hold the ISPs accountable since Title 2 is what gave the FCC the authority, and the FTC is also pretty useless and I can't for the life of me find where they get any kind of authority in the matter.

Anyway that's kind of the condensed version of my thoughts here it's early in the morning and I want some coffee. Please just let this die or agree to disagree.
WeepingAngelTears,I don't want the monopolies to be broken apart by the government. You're missing my point. The regulations that are keeping the monopolies around are barriers to entry. Google has tried to push fiber but was beaten by the other ISPs using regulations. Remove the regulations and suddenly you have more competition. 
HalLogan,Couple things here. First off, that's not a true statement and I challenge you to defend it. 

But let's say hypothetically that it's true. *IF* the absence of open competition exists because of the current regulatory environment - and *IF* we accept that lifting net neutrality requirements will in no way pave the way for open competition among providers - then shouldn't we address the absence of open competition before lifting NN requirements?

This is what it looks like in Portugal without NN.

E: feel free to share, spread and post this image wherever you see fit.
PMmeyoursecretz,The Portugal link isn't true. That picture refers to a bolt on to a mobile data plan and is nothing to do with regular internet provided by ISPs.

Portugal is part of the European Union, and abides by Union laws on net neutrality. Please don't spread fake news.
HalLogan,Respectfully disagree. Mobile providers are the last mile just like Comcast or Verizon, and for many young adults they and the wifi at Starbucks are the only last mile they traverse. They're charging for access to services rather than straight metered bandwidth, which is one of the outcomes lifting NN can lead to.
PMmeyoursecretz,You're welcome to disagree :)

But saying Portugal doesn't have net neutrality is straight up wrong. It does, and it has to, because of EU legislation. That photo isn't showing charging for access to services. It is showing you can pay an additional amount to have unlimited access to those services even if you exceed your data plan.

HalLogan,I stand corrected, thanks!

Burndown9,I'm pretty neutral on the nn thing but the more freaking out, sensationalist stuff I see that people refuse to back up with any logic, the more anti I get. If your only argument is to insult people that hold different opinions, maybe your argument is trash.
Kaarous,>  sensationalist stuff I see that people refuse to back up with any logic,

Of course they don't.  That's because their basic position is that we will all be sent to the Dark Ages of Dialup if a 2015 Obama admin regulation is removed.  It's patently ridiculous.

They're lying through their teeth, or else stupid enough to believe their own spiel.  
Dem6n654,So instead of just down voting you, here are my thoughts. Yes it could be seen as over the top with so many posts about it, but the potential consequences are drastic and could change the internet for the worst.
Some say that prior to NN in 2015(?) "We didn't have the issues of paygated websites so why bother fighting it now"? 
For me the fact that there COULD be a paygate on youtube, or Reddit, or (insert popular site here) is enough to stand against it. Companies seem to only want more money without really earning it, and the worst company interactions I have had are with ISPs.
Thanks for reading.
Burndown9,Yeah I totally get the line of thought - better safe than sorry, right? And if you plopped buttons in front of me right now to keep or repeal nn, I'd keep it, just because I don't know what the ramifications of repealing it might be. At the same time, I consider myself undecided, because I simply haven't heard enough of both sides yet. Thanks for your thought out response
TazerLazer,Hey I can help here! A big talking point of the anti net neutrality crowd is that it's not really doing anything, and it's never helped us and is just some sort of government power grab.
[Here are some sourced examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/69dnox/fcc_chief_net_neutrality_rules_treating_internet/dh6ezem/)
of times when net neutrality has directly stopped telecoms from screwing us.

Also, a big talking point is that the switch to title two regulation was unwarranted and unprovoked. But the entire reason the FCC switched to title 2 in the first place is that [Comcast and Verizon won a series of court battles that would gut net neutrality](https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5311948/net-neutrality-and-the-death-of-the-internet) if they didn't make the switch.

So when someone tells you the rules wern't protecting anything and the switch to title 2 was unwarranted, remember that the telecoms were batting in court for years to destroy them, and essentially forced the FCC to switch to title 2 in the first place.
Burndown9,But aren't all those cases from before 2015?? Thanks for the response!!

Slixem,Here are 2 articles against Net Neutrality for you to read just to be informed on both sides.

http://www.dailywire.com/news/18613/7-reasons-net-neutrality-idiotic-aaron-bandler
TazerLazer,Yes they are! In 2015 the FCC switched the internet to title 2 and the FCC got a lot better legal footing to stop this sort of thing, so I imagine people stopped trying their luck as much? Keep in mind the only reason they switched to title 2 in the first place is to keep being able to enforce net neutrality regulations that had already been in place. [Here is a wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States)  about the history if you're interested
Burndown9,That's fair. I still think it's pointless, since this seems like a whole fucking lot of frenzy over such a small piece of legislation
Drasha1,It protects the core concept of the internet. Without it we will likely see the internet morph into something we don't recognize.
DiscordDraconequus,You have to consider the consequences of letting ISPs basically do whatever they want. What the ISPs want to do is they want to use their "control of the tubes" in order to affect what goes through them.

Imagine for a moment that Comcast, for some bizarre reason, decided that they wanted to make their own tabletop RPG. Lets call it Pungeons and Pragons. They make a P&P wiki, a P&P alternative to Roll20, they sell digital copies of their books, the whole nine yards. Except P&P sucks. It's terrible, unbalanced, and stupid. Nobody likes it, nobody plays it.

So what does Comcast do?  They use their positions as ISPs to attack D&D content, throttling bandwidth and speeds to make them nigh-unusable. Roll20 suddenly lags to hell if you're using Comcast. All the D&D wikis are unreachable. Downloading a digital copy of a D&D or Pathfinder book suddenly takes hours to finish. And at the same time, they start advertising for P&P on their website, on their e-mail service, and on their monthly billing statement, specifically making sure to advertise that *they're* the ones with fast, reliable service.

And this isn't just some contrived made-up hypothetical. Comcast tried to do this to shut down Netflix since it competes with their television service. AT&T did the same with Skype since that competes with landlines. 

Net Neutrality prevents ISPs from picking winners and losers when it comes to internet content. ISPs shouldn't be able to hold your content hostage, either to promote their own alternative or ransom it for higher speed from you or the content creators (or both!).

Burndown9,Yeah man, I'll try. I just hate writing posts on mobile it blows. I'm glad people are bonding over something they find important, but the vitriol I see all over Reddit against people that don't agree, or even are undecided like me, drives me far, far away from the shared mindset.
Zhesbele,I agree, writing long things on mobile sucks, but it's hardly fair to be a dick about it. I apologize if my initial post came off as snobby but I was legitimately confused as to what you were trying to say.

There's always a lot of nuance to all of these legal things, and I'm sure that the bandwagon is missing a lot of it, but part of me is just really fed up with having people try to even make it possible for bad things to happen. I know there wasn't a precedent before, but from what I hear there have been some instances of bandwidth throttling, and with the data cap stuff going on now I just don't really trust ISPs to have the consumer in mind. But I also understand not thinking that it will be an immediate hostile takeover. It's just a lot, and emotions are hot right now all around. I hope you have a good Thanksgiving, I'll be going to bed soon 👍
Burndown9,Yeah no it's entirely my bad I was being a dick. I'm being insulted in like four different Reddit threads rn so I was a little defensive, but of course that's not an excuse. You have a good night and a good Thanksgiving :)
erikdewhurst,Yes. Every person on the internet in America is affected by this.
thetracker3,And even people NOT in america will be slightly affected by it. Imagine if ISPs here in america start charging youtube more to not be throttled? You really think that's not going to have some effect on youtube, that will then have an effect on you as a viewer? Or even a content creator?

And then, it'll eventually come for the rest of the world.
Chozo_Hybrid,Yep. Sucks that this can have an effect on me in my country, yet have no say it seems.

Slixem,All of this fear-mongering is hilarious.
HumansWillComeForYou,I was exaggerating, but Net Neutrality just means that all content is and stays equal. The moment you do away with it, companies have many ways to block content or overcharge for it. Maybe they won't, but they'll probably will fuck you over one way or another. Why even take that chance? Keep the net equal for all.


What reason is there not to want that?

HumansWillComeForYou,>This is a bad idea for the same reason that only having vanilla ice cream for sale is a bad idea: some people want, and are willing to pay for, something different. Forcing a one-size-fits-all solution on the Internet stifles innovation by blocking some companies from turning new ideas or business models into successful products.


That's not at all how that works. Right now all ice-cream flavours are available, for all to consume. The moment you do away with Net Neutrality you will have to pay extra to gain access to Strawberry flavour, or maybe Chocolate pays the provider to block other flavours so more people will eat Chocolate flavour.


It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, it's just not forcing people pick a size at all. 


You won't be paying extra to get 'personalised' internet, you'll be paying more just to not be limited. Right now internet is as personalised as it gets, because you get to choose what you see. Just you. Not the companies or the government.


They say they want to stop the censorship, but they *are* the censorship.


Please realize you're just losing here, there's nothing to be won.
Slixem,So as soon as net neutrality goes away all ISPs will immediately bundle all of their websites into cable packages? This is fear-mongering, naked doomsday prophet ranting levels of stupid.
HumansWillComeForYou,Why even allow them the possibility? What is there to gain from losing the equality of data? Only the companies could profit from it, and your reasoning is based around the fact that they might not do anything.


Also, there's no reason for them to not do it. It's profit without investment, basically free money. If you only have a single provider available, you'll have no choice but to pay up. Because internet is absolutely necessary in modern society, not having it is not an option for most people.
Slixem,I prefer a free market approach that will fix the root problem which is regional monopolies by ISPs.
HumansWillComeForYou,Doing away with Net Neutrality is terrible for the free market. It'll take away one of the largest platforms where people can take part in the free market, the equal internet.


Local monopolies of providers are a large problem as well, and it will get much *much* worse if Net Neutrality is lost, because they can use their monopolistic position to block sources that call them bad, and charge insane extra fees for basic functionality.
Rattlerkira,Its free market, if it blocks important things people will a) stop paying so they have to show it, or b) a new company will come out using net neutrality
HumansWillComeForYou,With that argumentation you ignore the fact that many areas only have one provider available, and that people simply cannot go without internet nowadays. You need it for everything! People won't have a choice but pay/put up with the providers shenanigans.


Another provider could take months or years to show up, if that even were to happen. People can't wait that long, internet is one of the most important things a home has nowadays, right after gas, electricity and water. It's like saying that gas companies overcharging wouldn't be a problem because a new company might show up with lower prices.
Rattlerkira,What do you think net neutrality is?
HumansWillComeForYou,Equality of all data, providers and governments may not hinder or alter what you can and cannot see, or slow your speed to/charge you for access to certain sources.


What did you think it was?
Rattlerkira,Also, whats to say that hey dont charge ludicrous prices now? Net neutrality has nothing to do with that
HumansWillComeForYou,Yet a lack of Net Neutrality would open a whole new world of possibilities that would only make that worse.


They often do, Comcast is famous for it's high prices and failure to deliver on its promises. Do you really want a company like that to control what you do and do not have access to on the internet? They actually already tried, they secretly slowed down peer to peer connections until the FCC ordered them to stop. How far will they go if it's legal?

Rattlerkira,They already do, the only difference is they decide everything together, the only thing that net neutrality would dictate is, they can decide what you pay for, aryificially slowing stuff down is still illegal.
HumansWillComeForYou,Without Net Neutrality artificially slowing down internet speeds or even blocking content is legal, that's quite literally the issue.

technicalrogue,Thanks Reddit (and whoever makes it manufacture a WALL OF NET NEUTRALITY posts)....


I thought this was a site where the most up-voted went to the top, not the top of someone's agenda.


I find it hard, if not impossible to believe, that EVERY GOD DAMNED SUB upvotes (in the 10's of thousands, with little participation) an IDENTICAL post about net neutrality.



In fact, not only is it hard to believe, but easy to see that there is an agenda and a manufactured "uprising". 



As a result, I want to rethink my stance on this net neutrality - because obvioulsy Reddit can, at any time, just force a narrative down my throat... THANKS REDDIT.


You sincerely suck.
PM-ME-SEXY-CHEESE,Its pretty disgusting tbh. 
PM_me_ur_PAWG_booty,You do realize net neutrality has nothing to do with what Reddit posts and how the administration of the site behaves? It has to do with how ISPs determine what you have access to. You're talking about something completely different, you're talking about unregulated open forums with what you perceive as a bias towards a narrative. Which really I guess would just be "go to a different site" worthy. Because the only way you could form an opposite opinion would be arguing for regulation of moderation in public forums.... Which isn't net neutrality related and would have free speech ramifications.
technicalrogue,> Which isn't net neutrality related and would have free speech ramifications.

Yeah, and then?


What if I want a free and open internet AND the ability to have free speech appended to it?



What would you call that? Give everyone equal and open access to the internet and all its content... would you call that neutrality? Net Fairness? 


I'm OK with rules, but the rules should favor neutrality, fairness. Equal time, so to speak. 



We have those elsewhere, why not the internet?
PM_me_ur_PAWG_booty,What like the fairness doctrine? That hasn't been a law since 2011. The current administration would never allow it back in place, especially not on the internet. Best you could do would be to look at private forums with impartiality rules in their mission statements. Private coorporations have no obligation to treat anyones speach fairly.

I know this is too late to gain much traction but, if we really want to ruffle feathers we should make the choices that ARE available to us. We should choose to kill Verizon wireless as a mobile service. Contracts are gone for many and there are other mobile options in almost every area. 

Switch. 

Sure Verizon isn’t the sole bad actor but we can select a single target and kill it swiftly to show the power of the populace still reigns over corporations. 

Kill Verizon wireless with severe prejudice. Do it today.

Arluza,I mean, we've already lost. This is what....attempt number....5? 7? within 2 years?

Let's face it. Like in Planescape or Forgotten realms, there are certain HARD LINE rules to morality dependent on your location. In the USA, morality is determined by how much gold you have in your bank account. 

THESE PEOPLE ARE MORE ETHICAL THAN YOU. They are also smarter than you (because money ALSO is clearly a sign of intelligence. Just look at the President. he's OBVIOUSLY a genius).

And if you disagree with me on that last paragraph, you're free to be wrong (though it will cost you more money to actually VOICE that opinion soon.) But it's no argument that the oligarchs want more control over you, the poor and useless piggy bank. 

Unless you can fork over roughly....eh, 900 billion dollars, let's start, to the congressmen and FCC lobbyists, you are NOT going to be heard in this conversation.We collectively have no voice at this table because we are too poor. Even if we gather together all of the money all 347,819 of us have, even if each person here put in 1000 USD, it's not gonna buy you a vote. 347 million bucks is literal pocket change to these people.

You will NOT outbid Verizon (the FCC chair's former boss), You won't outbid Comcast. You won't outbid AT&T. And quite frankly, you're a FUCKING IDIOT if you think you have a shot. 

Unlike D&D, there's not a magical D20 which gives you a 5% chance of everything happening. IF ANYTHING, you've got a D4. And frankly, I'm giving you a lot more credit than you actually can purchase here. 

And I'm calling it here. If the December 14 vote, by a miracle of God doesn't go in favor of Chairman Very-Punchable Face, he's gonna do another vote, and another, and another, and another. 

He's got YEARS to wear you down. And you're the motherfucking INTERNET. A week is a year, and a year is a century. Chairman Very-Punchable can issue a new vote as often as he likes, and he's gonna be there until AT LEAST January 2021.

GlobalPowerElite,Ajit Pai is very articulate and sensible in his arguments against Net Neutrality. 

Here is a quote of his criticism against Internet neutrality, stating that the perceived threats from ISPs to deceive consumers, degrade content, or disfavor the content that they dislike are non-existent: "The evidence of these continuing threats? There is none; it's all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria. A small ISP in North Carolina allegedly blocked VoIP calls a decade ago. Comcast capped BitTorrent traffic to ease upload congestion eight years ago. Apple introduced Facetime over Wi-Fi first, cellular networks later. Examples this picayune and stale aren't enough to tell a coherent story about net neutrality."
This wiki copypasta disproves most of the echo chamber comments against Ajit Pai.

Net Neutrality is a Silicon Valley corporate campaign against TeleCommunication companies control over pricing of ISP and data speed. 

Google/Facebook/Netflix and other websites vs. AT&T/Comcast/Verizon and other broadband. 

This does not affect the consumer in any significant way. NN is unnecessary regulation. The internet is not broken. Leave it alone. 
And please research and verify this on your own. 
(Notice that NN is heavily promoted on Reddit and other social media figures)
HalLogan,The problem with Pai's argument goes like this: 

1. ISP's have publicized a desire to introduce a "fast lane" where providers would have to pay them for their users to get decent access to their services. So even if they haven't been caught red-handed degrading traffic that competes with their own services, they've indicated a desire to do so.

2. Arguing that it's never happened is a case of proving a negative because a normal end user can't tell whether or not their traffic is being throttled. If he doesn't know that then he isn't qualified to work in a level 1 help desk position, let alone lead the FCC. But he actually does know that, he's just a sociopath and a liar.

3. There absolutely are cases of ISP's deliberately taking action to degrade traffic that Pai isn't acknowledging. One that received quite a bit of publicity is, a few years ago Verizon deliberately refrained from adding bandwidth to connect its customers to Level 3 because Level 3 is the primary ISP you go through to hit Netflix. By not adding bandwidth to keep up with demand, they were able to degrade the quality of traffic to Level 3 and therefore Netflix. That's not a small ISP blocking VoIP. Also side note: screw anyone who disregards an ISP blocking VoIP as trivial. There are schools on VOIP systems that use them to call 911 and I'm pretty sure they don't think it's trivial. It's the FCC's job to make sure that type of communication works and is held above competitive interests. And if anyone reading this doesn't care about people in North Carolina, Verizon's decision to influence traffic to Level 3 comes back into play because Level 3 is also a voice provider. See how dangerous of a precedent we're setting?

Also not particularly relevant to the above, but if you need more evidence of the malice on the part of providers it's worth pointing out that when Netflix posted stats on which ISP's had the best and worst experience connecting to them, Verizon sued them. Just sayin.

Outside of the reasons why Pai is ~~incorrect~~ a liar, the reason companies like Reddit, Google, Facebook et al dig their heels in is two-fold. The first is philosophical: the next Google or Reddit won't be able to get off the ground if they have to pay not only for their own hosting, but also for the last mile ISP's to not degrade their traffic. But more importantly and more practically, lifting Network Neutrality has two possible conclusions. One is that web-based services have to build those additional "fast lane" costs into their models, which they in turn have to pay for by throwing even more ads around and finding other ways to monetize their service to the detriment of their content and viewing experience. The other is that end-users have to pay extra fees for the services they want to use, and their Internet plans start to look like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNGlrABUIAAr9RO.jpg).

Source for all of the above: I've been building and securing networks for twenty years. I work for a cloud-based VOIP provider that makes heavy use of Level 3. If I worked for your ISP I could write router configs in my sleep that screwed with your Netflix or Playstation or Xbox traffic on certain days of the week and certain times of the day - all without showing up on pings, traceroutes, or speed tests - and you wouldn't be able to tell if your ISP was throttling the traffic or if the service you were hitting was having problems. If anyone reading this thinks I'm incorrect and thinks they know how networks work better than I do they're welcome to speak up.
DekwaDoes,"The internet is not broken. Leave it alone"

That is precisely what we are trying to achieve. It is the ISPs, and by extension through their lapdog Pai, the FCCs intention to 'fix' the internet, by adding their regulations...

We want the internet as it is, free. Their regulations will make it caged and under control of the (American) ISPs.

The internet is a world phenomenon. There is no copyright on the infrastructure that is the internet. The American ISP lobby is attempting to gain control over something that they have no right to control at all.

...but you're busy these days. Don't bother calling your senators. 
maxwellbegun,A new era? Compared to the first 32 years it existed without net neutrality? Come on, let's not pretend we're protecting anything here- NN only began two years ago.
ShutteredIn,Net neutrality was around before 2015.
maxwellbegun,As a concept? Sure. FCC enforced net neutrality (which is what they're voting on) is only two years old.
Burndown9,... Like it happened before net neutrality? Oh wait it didn't....
CacophonyCrescendo,Plenty of examples friend.

https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7ej1nd/fcc_unveils_its_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/dq5hlwd
Burndown9,The comment shows how all of those were resolved WITHOUT nn. Please show me *why* nn is necessary, it's not hard.
Anterograde_Cynicism,Every single one of those is an example of Net Neutrality being enforced. It really sounds like you don’t know what Net Neutrality is and are just parroting conservative talking points.
Burndown9,Before the 2015 regulations. So why do need them
Anterograde_Cynicism,There are no 2015 regulations. Net Neutrality is the same now as it was before 2015.
Burndown9,Wiki:

"Until 2015, there were no clear legal protections requiring net neutrality...  On February 26, 2015, the FCC ruled in favor of net neutrality by reclassifying broadband as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and Section 706 of the Telecommunications act of 1996.[3][14][15] On April 13, 2015, the FCC published the final rule on its new "Net Neutrality" regulations.[16][17] These rules went into effect on June 12, 2015.[18]"
Anterograde_Cynicism,Huh, strange that you don’t actually link the Wikipedia page that says that, and you leave out a big portion in the middle. I wonder what could be missing.

>[In April 2014, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reported a new draft rule that would have permitted ISPs to offer content providers a faster track to send content, thus reversing its earlier net neutrality position. In May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two options: permitting fast and slow broadband lanes, thereby compromising net neutrality; and second, reclassifying broadband as a telecommunication service, thereby preserving net neutrality. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States)

Oh look, it’s the lines showing that the Net Neutrality doctrine was enforced before 2015, and what was actually considered was a change away from that doctrine. 

I wonder what else is missing from your dubious citation...

>In early 2005, in the Madison River case, the FCC for the first time showed willingness to enforce its network neutrality principles by opening an investigation about Madison River Communications, a local telephone carrier that was blocking voice over IP service. 

>In August 2008, the FCC made its first Internet network management decision.[38] It voted 3-to-2 to uphold a complaint against Comcast ruling that it had illegally inhibited users of its high-speed Internet service from using file-sharing software because it throttled the bandwidth available to certain customers for video files to ensure that other customers had adequate bandwidth.

>In December 2010, the FCC approved the FCC Open Internet Order banning cable television and telephone service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites such as Netflix. On December 21, 2010, the FCC voted on and passed a set of 6 net "neutrality principles"

Net Neutrality doctrine was already in place. The only thing that happened in 2015 was a failed attempt to change those rules and a reclassification of ISPs as common carriers so that there was clear precedent to enforce the already existing Net Neutrality rules. There were no new regulations.
WikiTextBot,**Net neutrality in the United States**

In the United States, net neutrality has been an issue of contention among network users and access providers since the 1990s. In 2015 the FCC classified broadband as a Title II communication service with providers being "common carriers", not "information providers".

Until 2015, there were no clear legal protections requiring net neutrality. Throughout 2005 and 2006, corporations supporting both sides of the issue zealously lobbied Congress.

jampayne,End of the world? Nope. End of the Internet? Well, yes, it won't be the same. The internet should be a utility tbh, not a tool to price gouge people and businesses.
maxwellbegun,The internet existed for 32 years without NN, and two years with it. How could it possibly be "not the same"?
yaforgot-my-password,They're has always been Net Neutrality, where did you get theidea that it hasn't always been a thing?
maxwellbegun,FCC enforced net neutrality began two years ago in 2015. For 32 years before that the Internet was just fine.

Where'd you get the idea otherwise?
Burndown9,Probably a Google search, which will let you know the regulations were published April 13 2015
yaforgot-my-password,But the internet still had Net Neutrality. Those regulations were put in place to keep it that way.
Burndown9,And the current debate is about keeping them from repealing said regulations, yes?
Zeig9,Because that's a lie. Net Neutrality has been around for decades. The only thing that changed in 2015 is that the FCC was forced to classify ISPs as common carriers under Title II in order to keep enforcing those rules.

But you already know that you pathetic shill. You're in every single Net Neutrality thread across subs spewing the same bullshit.
maxwellbegun,I'm in two threads, mate. One in D&D, one in a sub for PICTURES.

I don't want politics in those subs. But the shills (as you call them) have forced politics where it shouldn't be.

And FCC enforced net neutrality came into being two years ago. And all that's at stake with this vote is the FCC enforcement.
yaforgot-my-password,There's a lot of them doing it. Are they shills or trolls?

Execute13,Very nice work, though the owl perched on bare skin makes me wince in sympathetic pain. Those talons are for killin'!
ClemPrime13,Mage Armor is on the bard spell list, right?
vipchicken,Mage armour
zeylin,Bards got some DR.  No worries.
Aioni,They can be painful but the real damage from an owl’s talons is the strength at which it can grip. A tawny owl has about twice the gripping strength of an adult Male, whereas an owl like the one in the picture could easily have 8-10x the gripping power! 

So long as they don’t squeeze, the worst you would feel is the talon slightly pricking the skin, which to be fair is still less than desirable haha.
TrueAngryYeti,Can confirm have 3 talon scratches on left arm from a barred owl I was handling yesterday. Not anywhere near bad, sorta just like a cat scratch though. But that depends on the bird and if they wanna hurt you or not, this owl didn't.
xcbsmith,Women have suffered worse for fashion. ;-)
Salsa__Stark,As the owner of a pair of fabulous but absolutely sinister 5-inch spike heels, I can confirm.
discontinuity,Mmmmmmmmmm.


BobKehl,haha I know, my reasoning was.. because fantasy?
rtrs_bastiat,For what it's worth I've held many birds of prey on bare skin, they're not gonna hurt you unless they intend to or you move them too fast. Perfectly fine to hold most birds that way.
mortemdeus,You can round off talons and you can cast barkskin as a bard. Either is acceptable!
Endarkend,What was her reaction?
GODDDDD,Idk man I love a girl with some thicc shoulder calluses
KJ6BWB,I figured there must be a broad thick hardened leather pad at the top of that strap on her far shoulder just for it to perch on?  There's no other way it can perch on her without doing damage -- owls can't grip gently.

Anyway, so does she have a level of wizard/sorcerer or druid or something for the owl?
Nat_1_IRL,Find Familiar is a first level wizard spell in 5e. You can nab it with the magic initiate feat. 
KJ6BWB,Feats are rarer though, right?  You have to give up two attribute bumps?
Nat_1_IRL,Yes, but with the way magic items work, sometimes it's worth it.

Instead of bumping strength you can get a belt of storm giant strength and have 29 str. That way down the road though. It just depends on what's important to you. The two cantrips that come with it could be very helpful as well
mythozoologist,Magic Secret, Magic Initiate feat, Ritual Cast feat could get a bard a familiar. Or it's just an owl.
KJ6BWB,If some random owl decided to buzz my face that closely, I'd be freaking out.
Yenek,Could have used a Magical Secret for Conjure Familiar
ShitThroughAGoose,Maybe she has talon scars on that side of her shoulder/neck, to signify her not giving a fuck.
SumthingStupid,Or a sick pauldron for this
PickLeadBeets,That’s badass
phadewilkilu,This is my first thought. Would add some depth of character on just how tough she is, and show how long her and her familiar have been together. Which can translate to how much they’ve been through. 
Textual_Aberration,I like to imagine that the owl poses like that every time anyone looks at it, too.
Nat_1_IRL,Yeah, the owl has the jealous boyfriend stare. It makes me glance away in shame, even though I was just admiring the artist's work.

Love the detail btw. This entire piece is incredible and makes me want to see the world
Textual_Aberration,It definitely looks overprotective, but it's funner to focus on that fluffy head-press it's doing and see an adorably insecure bird rushing to act big like a pint-sized dragon demonstrating its tiny fire.

Not quite what the artist intended but I prefer the layer of friendly doofiness.

jk1837,This is awesome and I love bards!

If i may give a small critique? I think her right wrist is a little too thin even from a side angle and its messing with my head on whether that forearm is a little too long or not. If its just the thickness messing with my head then the length may be fine. or that forearm maybe just a tad too long as well. I think if the curve of the wrist started right where the bracelet ends it should be fine. 

I think the rest of it looks really really great though and i enjoy this piece very much!
Fleudian,Also the East-West of the compass rose is backwards.

RupanIII,Wonderful piece. I do have a couple of point of constructive criticism. First is that the birds wings look too faded compared to the body. I get what you were going for but it looks a little off. Second, what is the bird perching on? I see one foot by her neck but I'm not sure where the second one is. Maybe I am not seeing it. Last, her wrist is bent too far. It's 90° if not more. Wrists don't bend like that naturally. It sounds like a be lot but really it's minor quibbles. Chalk it up to me watching Ink Master. 
krapht,My wrist bends 90 degrees :(

KeepWashingtonGreen,This is really good, but there is one glaring and obvious problem.  Only two of the following statements can be true at the same time:

1. This girl has bare shoulders.  
2. This girl has an owl sitting on her shoulder.  
3. This girl isn't screaming in pain and spraying blood everywhere.

A leather shoulder rest would allow the owl to sit on her shoulder without causing injury.  Or you could just paint her screaming and flailing her arms as she runs around yelling "Get this fucking owl off me!"

Because right now, that girl has a bird with two and half inch long talons -- which is cannot retract -- clinging onto her shoulder.  Every time she takes a step, that owl gets jostled, and it tightens its grip.  Her shoulders would be a bloody, perforated mess. 

/source: my step-mother was an ornithologist who raised owls.
Fred4106,Hell, I have chickens and even their feet hurt if the bird thinks it's going to fall and squeezes. Also, when it decides your freckle is a bug and tries to eat it. Or your eyeball.
KeepWashingtonGreen,Birds are tiny dinosaurs and they have the claws to prove it.

juusukun,Maybe I'm just unversed in DnD, but where's the instrument(s)? She looks more like a scribe than a bard. Her notes in the book don't look musical/poetic
HalLogan,My assumption is that she's a lore bard, hence the scrolls. Maybe she tells inspiring tales, or leads the pirates in a rousing singalong?
juusukun,a lore bard?

kind of a redundant title since all bards tell lore and epic tales through music.

grasping at straws here.

If you want to go down that path though, I'd call her a bard scribe. Too busy to learn an instrument as she's always taking notes as per her scribe nature, yet she doesn't need one as she has a hauntingly beautiful voice to reshape her notes into majestic songs.

Still a stretch if you ask me, she's got a diagram of a ship in the book, looks like a scribe that leans more towards science than the arts if you ask me.

Also weird how the title says one thing, and then a comment from /u/BobKehl calls her something different
HalLogan,> a lore bard?

In 5th edition D&D there are bard subclasses referred to as colleges. The Player's Handbook defines a college of lore and a college of valor, with different abilities for each. An expansion book defines a few others as well. "Lore bard" is the colloquial way to refer to a bard who chooses the college of lore, and whose abilities indicate that they're wider read than bards of other colleges as reflected by additional skills and additional spellcasting.
juusukun,That sounds really cool! DnD has always been something that seems like I should have played, it's a shame none of my friends growing up we're into it.

Like I said I'm unversed in DnD. From the movies, shows, and games I've enjoyed that have had bards in them, everything I said in the previous comments just made sense.

Anyways thanks for filling me in I really appreciate it, you definitely know your shit!
HalLogan,You should try playing sometime, it's pretty fun. Especially playing as a lore bard. Fighter are all "I'll slice the dragon with my sword!" and wizards are "I'll channel arcane energy to blast him with a lighting bolt!" Then the bard comes along and says "When he tries to bite me I'll passively-aggressively insult him when he attacks me by saying 'Yeah, I guys those teeth are *kinda* ferocious seeing as how your mother was a wyvern.' Does that make him miss? Cool. Now I'm gonna light him up Faerie Fire so everyone else has a better chance of hitting him. Y'all got this right?"

Ibclyde,Yes, SOme Pirates haave monkeys Or Cats.  I Would assume a North Seas Pirate to have an Owl or Falcon.  I think the Parrot would Freeze there.

FUZZB0X,I completely understand what you're saying.  However, in real life, we don't jail people based on the ratio of their expected  *remaining* life.  For example: a 5 year sentence is a very different thing to a 70 year old than it is to a 15 year old.  

Time doesn't pass faster for an elf.  A boring day is just as boring to an elf as it is to a halfling. A year is a year, even if it's a lesser ratio of their overall expected lifespan.


rotarytiger,OP said lifespan, not remaining life. To a race that lives about 80 years, 20 years is a huge portion of that expected lifespan. To a race that lives 700 years, it's nothing.
FourOranges,The first part of your post is true, however as you age [time actually does seem to fly by faster.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/23/haunting-images-show-why-time-really-does-seem-to-go-faster-as-you-get-older/) For example, at age one a year is 100% of your life. At age 8, it's only 12.5%. 18 and a year is 5.56% of your life. 
>"As Kiener writes, your summer vacation in your first year of college feels as long as your whole 76th year."


I've seen this phenomenon mentioned in many fiction stories where elves or immortality is present. A character will mention how humans will die in the span of a breath to them, etc etc.
Jernsaxe,That quote is pretty metal :-)

physalisx,>mass murder of prolific citizens and officials

Lol, they would be executed, whatever their race.
Jernsaxe,This was my first thought aswell, but in a world with resurrection, is the death penalty really the most effective punishment? :)
poduszkowiec,Resurrection is expensive as hell.
Jernsaxe,So fine the offender instead of killing them is what you are saying? :)
None,It is if you lock the remains up somewhere. Of course, if somebody with lots of resources broke into the vault where the remains of the country's most notorious criminals, that could have some interesting consequences...  
  
  Well, looks like I have a new quest idea.
Jernsaxe,True resurrection bypasses the need for the remains.  
None,True, but if you're the type of person with access to a level 17 Cleric I don't think it really matters what the punishment is. You could probably break out of jail pretty easily too.
Jernsaxe,Which is why you need to think outside the box when punishing high level characters :-)

Old GM of mine once had a guardsquad set off a MK disjunction on the party. The theory behind this was that while the guards might still lose the fight, when backup arrived the PCs where fucked, and even if they ran they where down a whooooole lot of items. This taught them the valuable lesson of behaving in towns with a mageguild :)
hardolaf,High level characters are like gods compared to the average NPC. Compared to the kingdom's court wizard, they are like a portal to the nine plains opened on the battlefield. 

A fifth level character is a good approximation for an Olympic athlete, Nobel Prize winner in the sciences, a Wolf Prize recipient, a general, or a president in the real world. Just think about that for a bit.

Adventurers are like the Greek heroes. They are bigger than life itself. They are the people that myths are written about. 

But it's a fantasy world, so there will be some equally mythical persons in society. But how powerful are they? 

Elminster, a person so powerful that he dines with the overgod, is a level 35 character in 3rd edition. So let's call that an upper bound to how powerful you can be without being a deity.

Most soldiers and guards are between 1st and 3rd level in that same edition. Generals tend to be between 9th and 11th level. And few cities are big enough on the prime plane to attract persons above 14th level as permanent residents. Even then, there are only a few handful of people above 9th in a metropolis (largest class of city in D&D 3rd edition for the prime plane).

So really, there isn't anyway to realistically punish high level characters to justice barring some servant of a god or abnormally powerful character existing on the prime plane. Now out in the planes the makeup changes. But largely there are few creatures higher than an equivalent level 20. Even then, there are few creatures above 15th level. 
Jernsaxe,Thats why he used a MKD; punished even if they win the fight.

marcus_gideon,Depends on what you're hoping to accomplish by locking them up. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)#Philosophies

If you're locking people up for punishment, then it should be the same all around. Otherwise you're being racist, locking up Elves for longer just because they're Elves. 

If you're locking people up to keep them away from society, then longer sentences would make sense. But you'd probably be better off sending them to a more appropriate prison. Humans keeping an Elf would eventually grow old and die, and the next generation would take over guarding them without really knowing why. While Elves guarding an Elf would live long enough to remember. 
half_dragon_dire,> Humans keeping an Elf would eventually grow old and die, and the next generation would take over guarding them without really knowing why.

My PCs are so going to run in to a town with an ancient prison tower at it's center, containing a sole elven prisoner. Ten generations of guards have watched over her incarceration, and their great grandchildren will be the ones to watch her go free. The reason for her imprisonment is the stuff of local legend, with only a few of the most learned legal scholars aware of the truth.
sauerkrautsean,The philosophy for why there would be different sentences for different races uses the philosophy of prison time as a deterrent to crimes. For example, some countries demand a percentage of income or wealth as a penalty for illegal activity, rather than a flat rate, because the flat rate was an insignificant amount to very wealthy people, and didn't discourage them from the offending behavior. For creatures that live significantly longer, a flat prison sentence is much less of a deterrent than it would be for creatures with a shorter life span. 
Thugnificent646,This seems right, if you had to spend a month in prison for murder the thought would probably much more enticing for some.

It should be percentage based on projected lifetime. This isn't racism, because racism is treating someone different under often inaccurate prejudgments. All humans are humans capable of the same things. But a being that's 2x as strong or lives twice as long getting treated the same as a being that is lesser in that aspect isn't being treated equally, they're being given an advantage.
LURKEN,I know for example that speeding tickets in ~~Norway~~ is based on your income.

Edit: Did some research, its actually Finland and Denmark
Tasden,So what if it is racist? I don't think racism would mean the same in in a world with actual different races.
sunwukong155,wtf it's 2016, enough with that kind of talk
marcus_gideon,Remember this is also a world where racial wars have happened and could again. One kingdom makes a habit of locking up Elves just for being Elves, and pretty soon there's a guy riding an Elk outside with a ton of archers behind him. 
Easilycrazyhat,But it wouldn't be "locking up Elves just for being Elves." It's more "The punishment for X crime should be imprisonment for Y% of the perpetrator's life." Ripe for abuse? Definitely. But it is innocent enough at it's base. Would make an interesting world building trait for sure.
Tasden,Maybe but every world and every race would have it own view. 

I think most elven nations would let elves that willing left deal with the consequences and the laws of the nations they went to. Elves in general are xenophobic and when elves leave that is a parting they take from the kingdom. Would be different for a diplomat or an ambassador of course. 

And again, everyone is free to interpret any of these philosophies as they see fit.

Lazin,I think the fraction idea is great, but in practise with my players, I think I'd try to work with them to avoid saying "So 50 years pass, and as the two elves leave their cell they're greeted by 2 geriatric humans... the other two PCs" and if they try to break out, what difference does it really make if they're in for 2 or 50 years each. 
FaxCelestis,Yeah but maybe we could actually have a real use for that aging penalty and bonus table. 


  ======= 

script ====39
None,But isn't the average lifespan for Orcs shorter due to lower standard of living and lack of education within their communities, let alone the Orc on Orc violence that occurs at enormous rates, even within non-Orc communities.

Whilst their culture plays into it, it's probably not a good idea to hold them to the different cultural standards as the other races as it's proven to grow conflict with other prisoners and the larger society. Laws are implementation and standardized for a reason, otherwise next thing we know we'll have rules for the rich and rule for everyone else, like Duchess Clinton... Wait where am I, and what am I talking about again? 
Citadel_CRA,So you're saying the king should fund more after school programs just for orcs? What about school vouchers to private dwarven schools? 
None,I think it starts with culture and the family, a two parent orc familys do just as well as dwarves. But whilst talking about these issues we always fall into the false orc dwarf dichotomy. No1 talks about the elves yet they out perform both races on average and have a significantly lower crime rate, yet have larger admission requirements (than dwarves and orcs) for most wizarding schools. In most cases trying to discriminate to counteract racial imbalances only worsens racial tensions, though this could be fixed easier if wizarding schools gave scholarships to disadvantaged individuals instead of race based benefits. But what to I know, I'm just a gnome druid.

xeonicus,I would imagine this only becomes an issue in societies that have heavy racial mixing.  In a non-mixed society, punishments might be decided based on their unique social values.  For rather egregious crimes, exile is probably common.

This also forces you to decide a few things.  Is there a concept of citizenship in your world?  If an elf is living abroad, have they given up the right to their elven citizenship?  If not, does a city potentially ruled by humans have authority to punish them?  What would the nearest elven ruler have to say about this?  Are elves forced to accept the rules of human law when they leave home to travel?  If the society where punishment takes place is truly mixed, then perhaps punishment is truly just, but if the society is mostly run by humans then perhaps it's not?

script ====46
UUD-40,I am curious how you would incorporate jail time into dnd game play?

I could see it going many ways, but the one that sticks out most to me is have your players play from jail. Their new goal is to break out of prison without any weapons or armor. That seems like fun to me!

Although, this quest would be pretty easy if there is a player who can cast destructive spells. Nevertheless, I think it would be still fun to decide on a way to break out :)
elint,Big bad evil guy continues to grow in power or further his plans.  Party can spend as much time tryingto break their friend outas they want.  They may succeed,learn lessons, move on.  They may fail and he gets killed in prison.  They may all get caught and keep trying to break out.  Its a world.  Its the DM's job to let the players tell their story and to keep telling his, being as flexible or as rigid as he chooses.
slaaitch,Any self-respecting prison in a DnD world would have a staff wizard who maintains the anti-magic field.
Morgrid,And a backup wizard for when the first one is murdered by the pcs
CasuallyCreative,Knowing my group, there would need to be an infinite number of backup wizards to keep them.
Morgrid,Why is the wizard in full plate?
Superdorps,It's full *tortoise shell* plate, though, because the backup wizards have to be turtles all the way down.
Morgrid,I shiv the wizard!

Your shank shatters upon his shell.
Superdorps,Clearly the correct move is to attempt to grapple him in the hopes that once he's on his back, his arms and legs can't reach the ground and he can't get back up again.

Peanut-Butter-Thug,You have to consider: D&D is a world where there are options to revive a person after they have been killed.  In an area with such options available, 'murder' may not even be a concept, much less a crime.  Okay, so you caused someone to die... and then they were raised from death.  You caused them an inconvenience?

Oh, it's assault, surely.  And some form of antisocial behavior that the law of the land definitely doesn't want to continue, so it has to have some form of extra punitive penalty as a disincentive for people to do it.

But a *raise dead* spell is costly.  In 5th edition D&D, it's 1,250 gp to cast (using prices from the books), and I'm not sure if that includes the 500 gp diamond you need as a material component to cast the spell.  And then there's the cost of having to bring the person to full hit points, and the cost of dealing with all the mental anguish (the need for a *restoration* spell), time lost while dead, repair of clothes, laundering...  the point of this is, killing someone has an actual *value*.  A monetary value that it costs to set things right.

So if you want to set a jail term in such a society, I'd base it on that -- how much have you cost that society?  If jail is a labor camp sort of deal where prisoners labor to repay their debts, you set a price value on how much your labor is worth, minus the cost of room & board, and then you repay society at that rate.

Might take you twenty years.  Might take you five years.  Hell, depending on your abilities, might take you a couple of weeks.

Foux,Have the case go to a court or some sort of tribunal where race and stats would factor into the judge's decision. Perhaps a character/race with a high intelligence/wisdom/charisma could argue for a more lenient sentence based on factors such as their expected lifespan. 

Rather than a physical prison, also consider alternatives such as some sort of magical punishment, such as a cursed item or affliction (force exposure to vampirism or lycanthropy) or being sold to slavers/penal colony. This opens the possibility of creating a quest for escape, redemption and/or cures.

Either way, the ACTUAL point of modern prisons is rehabilitation... so this shouldn't really come into consideration.

But in the Faux-Medieval society that D&D takes place in? Pretty much all serious crimes are punishable by death. Large prisons mostly didn't exist, and certainly didn't have modern concepts of sentencing!
Dracomax,Well, no, not in the US. the theoretical point is rehabilitation, and in fact that is how the prison system got started, but the real purpose of prisons here is to make money and create more need for prisons.

Deviknyte,This is a really cool thought exercise. I think the answer comes in what society is holding judgement over them. I could imagine some societies wouldn't do this because it's not fair in their eyes. The perks of being long lived or immortal is that jail time is a drop. In the bucket. 

I can imagine "conservative" societies and judges being for this, especially if that society isn't long lived. Claiming that the punishment must be adjusted to elves and dwarves, else they aren't punished at all. 

I could imagine "progressive" societies or judges being for this. Reasoning that it would be terrible for say the short lived orcs, or whatever short lived race is in your campaign. They would claim it eats away at too much of their lives and thus unfair. I could also image a society/judge like this against this, claiming that keeping an elf captive for over 600 years is a sentence worst than death and torture. And I could see a "progressive" using both arguments under claim that these things need to be looked at through the eyes of each species. 

I can also see speciesism take place, where after killing a dwarven lord the dwarf in the party gets a shorter sentence while the human gets a worst and the orc and elf get sentenced to hang. And as someone else pointed out classism would probably be taken into effect.

fu_king,Not sure if anyone has thrown this in there.

Prison wasn't a thing until the 17th or 18th century.

Prior to that, criminals were punished with a fine, or some sort of physical punishment, or even servitude/slavery.  You'd occasionally have someone piss off a Lord or King, and they could conceivably end up in a cell, but that was generally more for political reasons.
HadrasVorshoth,I've heard that members of royal descent would be imprisoned rather than executed by their relations, since it means there's a 'spare' hanging around of close relation, to maintain the dynasty should the current ruler die.

I've also heard people take fantasy settings to be like Aussie frontier towns though: while new criminals would get jailed for crimes, frequently they have skills essential to the community to survive the harsh environment, so they get reduced sentences.

IrateGandhi,I like the idea of whoever is ruler sets the times. 

"Pay 1000 gp or wait 10 years. It's your call." This makes it "unfair" but "the kings ruling." 

In dire situations, I imagine death penalty would happen rather than long sentences. Plus, this causes races with shorter life spans to be more careful; creating disparities in the way races are viewed. Humans do not commit as many crimes because *not real reason * but those filthy elves don't care about a year or two. Theyve got hundreds. 

A human cares about every year. A dwarf may care about every decade. Etc.

Slinkyfest2005,Depends on the culture. Some human civilizations would probably not think about it. Others might just execute non-humans. I think a fairly large trading city or capital would probably take things like that into account but it ultimately comes down to the specifics of where they were caught. 

I have to say, were my PC'e caught killing nobility and high personages they'd be given a scene in which they could escape and then it's off to the gallows.

TheRedMambo,Oh God this title

I actually had this thought and brought it up in a campaign I'm currently running.  The accused were a half-elf and a dragonborn in an elven land. The elves made the point that prison sentences were completely pointless in most cases of crime because of the elves' lifespan, so keeping them incarcerated enough to properly rehabilitate them could take centuries, and be an incredible waste to the state. (Basically a military state, at this point)

So the courtroom hearing went on, and their punishment was originally death. It was reduced to getting beaten to near death by the ruler, the King Eternal, for plot reasons. 

This is a very specific case. I'm sure with a more multi-race court, prison sentences would differ on a person to person basis, but keep in mind that not every culture is so open minded.


  ======= 

script ====83
loss_of_clock,The mechanisms of law and order depend entirely on the nation the crime was committed. The details of law are not homogeneous, different regions will have different races with different values and different forms of government, or none of this, lawlessness. And remember depending on these factors, politics may also be part of the system of law and order. The time and situation may have an affect as well, i.e. a state of war between two nations.

You've asked an important question, now to do your job as the DM and use these factors as lenses to change your perspective. Put yourself in the place of the rulers and citizens of these different nations and try to imagine how they feel and think. The answer you see them having may be one you personally disagree with - this is an invaluable skill to constructing varied and interesting cultures.

For example, a colony of warrior wood elves obsessed with honor is constantly dealing with violent crime so they have a well developed system of punishment, in their minds, detached from bias. A death is a death is a death and they know exactly how long a person should be punished for murder. This does not bode well for those races of shorter lifespans. An elf may spend a third of his life incarcerated while the same would mean a life sentence for a human. These wood elves understand the argument against their system but have decided upholding the honor of their system is more important.

Conversely, an empire of men structured as a theocratic monarchy uses xenophobia to control its populace and thus justifies life span percentage based sentencing to punish the longer lived races in their borders. Especially so against their main economic rival, a nation of particularly wealthy and long lived dwarves. The judge presiding over this kangaroo court serves at the pleasure of his holy majesty, whom wishes to weave a narrative demonizing this dwarf nation in preparation of severing economic ties with it. The citizens love a show and love it when other races get their comeuppance.

Eacheure,Jails should have a clause where it is capable of being jail-broken under specific circumstances. And depending on the locale, the jail should best fit their own kind.

Low technology/primitive races should have jails where brute strength can break the cell. Expect sharing a cell with a orcling. If you murder, they'll forgive you if you bring the head of a rival chieftain.

High technology races should have jails where high dex and int are requirements to chance a successful lockpick. Expect sharing a cell with a dwarven smith. Murder is punishable by death, expect to die - unless if you can escape.

Arcane races should have jails where it ultimately comes down to willpower, charisma, and/or bureaucracy of the local government. Expect sharing a cell with a 600 year old mage. Murder is offensive enough to warrant a lifetime imprisonment or a grand curse to be placed upon your soul - think terminal illness or something. Because the death penalty is too barbaric, and they can also shrink you and place you in an arcane cell; there's plenty of prisoners here. Hire a good lawyer.

neotecha,I feel like this is something that could vary a lot per region or society or city or a lot of other factors.

I think cities that don't have a lot of philosophical backing (basically, if they don't place a lot of emphasis on the wisdom of monks and wizards), they're less likely to have not put much thought into their policies.  If we assume such a city houses mosty one race, that city could punish theft with some form of punishment (whipping, fines, chopping off hands, or some set jail time). Say they're human, so jail time would be appropriate for humans (say 10 years). If an elf was passing through and stole something, they would get that punishment in human terms -- 10 years.  Because they haven't thought about how this law might affect people from outside their city, that 10 years would likely apply as well, even though it's much less of a relative punishment. 

I think more philosophically based cities would take this into consideration, but would also err more into establishing rights for prisoners as well

That's just my impression


  ======= 

script ====89
Jernsaxe,I think what you need to decide is if this is an actual punishment (your players fucked up and need to feel it) or a plotdevice (fx. prisonbreak senario). If it is a plotdevice then sure, just multiply by the race difference so they "feel" the difference" but if you want to actually punish them according to race you should probrably think up something other then prisontime (which should be life for mass murder).

Personally as a GM I would hit them where it really hurts, their loot! I had a GM once that dropped a MK disjunktion on our party to make us stop killing randomly and it really thought us a lesson. 

In this case you could sentence them to "death by dungeon", take away all their loot and send them into a dungeon (ofcourse modified by the fact the players have no loot). To survive their sentence they have to fight their way out and they can use the dungeon to gear back up. But they will still feel the loss and if you are running an evil campaign the next quest can be stealing back what they lost :-)

FaxCelestis,I have played in many "all-evil character" campaigns. The interesting part is trying to not make every character into Charles Manson. 

I played a Lawful Evil knight once. Very corruptible but otherwise a pretty stand-up guy who got mixed in with the wrong crowd. 
waiwode,Yes.

But as someone who runs games? I want to have fun too, and I will have absolutely no fun if I have a player whose character runs around murdering people for fun. So... ...that game would close shop pretty quickly.
DoxBox,Suppose you'd have to structure the entire game around the idea.
waiwode,Oh sure. "Evil Games" are a thing. Different things for different people.

One really evil character in a party of players who want to be heroic might work, but will often be very disrupting to the group.

One "a little evil" character, like Jane from Firefly, or Spike on Buffy? That can work. 

Often the biggest barrier to these games' success can be separating player knowledge from character knowledge.

script ====95
TheCodexx,I'd do it by who is sentencing them.

If the crime was committed in an Elven country, then the sentencing should be fair, but adjusted for Elven lifespans. Maybe an *incredibly* just system would make exceptions for the "lesser" races, but on the other hand, they *are* outsiders...

Dwarves are likely to have a system and stick to it. Although they might also have harsher penalties for certain groups they hate. Sentences might be "longer" on average (compared to Humans) but not by much.

Human society probably has all sorts of quirks and oddities that affect the ruling. Each town might even have its own set of laws for sentencing. I imagine there'd be a lot of favoritism, and possible discrimination, based on everything from species to whether you come from the next town over.

Hobbits... do they even have courts and need to imprison people? I imagine they'd just have a town hall and figure out what to do. Perhaps over dinner. Perhaps the punishment is that they have to sit out the dinner.

Orcs likely have brutal punishments to long ones. 

In short, I don't think it would be proportional based on age. That sounds like a "theoretically fair" system: proportional punishment. You lose a certain percentage of your life based on your crime. But the reality is, most justice systems aren't going to work that way, or be designed with outsiders in mind. They're going to conform to what that group wants out of a justice system. If they do have differing lengths, it's only because they were designed for that lifespan in mind.

That being said, I like the idea of a magical prison that estimates lifespan and adjusts sentencing accordingly.

humantargetjoe,Yeah, but that's because of time off due to good behavior, parole, appeals, and sentence reductions.  A "Life" sentence can be a fixed number of years, or it can be given without the possibility of commutation.

JakePPetersen,That's freaking hilarious!! Although if it's a Good character who committed a mistake, I don't think a year or two in Heaven is much of punishment. Maybe we could steal from Star Trek and have an illusionist/memory charmer implant the memories of X years in brutal prison and let them go the next day...

Jechtael,Proportional sentencing makes sense, but what about races with no maximum lifespan like (in 3.5) Warforged, Elan, and certain Fey? Could a village take advantage of their country's laws to permanently enslave a Warforged (bad example, people are SO racist against Warforged) for 3% of eternity for aggravated assault within city limits? Maybe the Warforged would have to work for the village or its successors for one year out of every thirty until it dies.

JakePPetersen,I thought this was in /r/politics from my front page and came in expecting a s**t-show...

I feel like mass Murder warrants a death sentence for that particular party, but for lesser crimes I do agree that a jail term should be based on a race's life span. A 10 year sentence just isn't the same to a 750 year span elf as it is to a 75 year span human.

HOLDINtheACES,Coming from someone who doesn't play D&D, how do you handle a player spending time in jail within the context of the campaign?  Do they sit out play sessions?  Does the whole party and the story skip the time period of imprisonment?
JakePPetersen,The bad guy (if there is one) gets a few months or years to advance his plan uninterrupted, and the DM has a chance to shuffle the NPCs the party had met: some have advanced, or moved to new positions, new alliances are made and broken, etc.
HOLDINtheACES,So in terms of players, the campaign progression pauses, but the world itself readjusts for the time.

Gotcha. Thanks.
JakePPetersen,In the meantime they could try to role play some prison drama or try to engineer an escape, or they could just take a time skip (like in Skyrim when you go to jail). Plenty of opportunity for good gaming all around.

NoNameMonkey,It depends on where you want it to go?  Personally i would say it opens up a bunch of story options for you.
What I would do:

1. Death or maiming for all non-noble people.  I would go with maiming because it keeps them in the game.  They get sentenced to an island prison where the next part of the adventure plays out.

2. Noble characters are expelled from the country.  They families live in shame.

3. The Elven and Dwarven courts claim that only they can sentence their people so a diplomatic spat occurs but the characters are sentenced alongside their human comrades anyway either openly or in secret.

4.  The party members get sent to the island prison where they can either plot their escape or they get recruited in a Suicide Squad type group by a shadowy government / noble group.

5.  The island is a harsh place where they spend months locked up in small cells, wasting away before they are released into the general populous.

And on and on and on...

SecTrono,lol typically mass murder would get life in prison or death, probably death. either way the sentence should be so long that it doesn't really matter since i would assume your players are going to break out of prison long before their sentence is up. that or you could place a good size portion of your campaign in prison, which would be pretty cool.

i don't think there would normally be a clearly defined law in most places. the punishment would be whatever the judge or king wanted it to be. they could be fair or they could abuse the fuck out of their power. i think its much more likely that the dwarf gets a longer sentence because the judge doesn't like dwarves rather than because they live longer.

Other fantastical governments would punish different races identically as a result of the application of ideological principles, either justly or unjustly.

If you are asking a moral question, like if I were king and there were both elves and wolfmen in my kingdom I would say absolutely not. Prison sentences are used for rehabilitation, deterrence, justice, and vengeance. Not all four of those things have a place in my kingdom.

O-Ther,How about those kobolds that surrendered and the paladin in the party insisted on taking the prisoners to the nearest village to face justice? Kobolds live shorter than humans, so do they get reduced sentences for banditry, thievery, etc. than a human would get? 

My answer is hell no. Kobolds are evil. Their deity is evil, and has a vested interest in the kobolds doing evil things. They would be put to the sword so the village wouldn't have to divert food, water, guards, and other resources to jail evil creatures that are beyond redemption. The humans are in it for the species, competing with kobolds, goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, gnolls, and many more that also worship evil deities for finite resources. Humans and demi-humans could change their ways, but evil non-humans? If the party is far from a village, the paladin could kill them and not suffer an alignment change at all. 
FaxCelestis,The only creatures that have more trouble changing alignments are those that come from the aligned planes. Kobolds aren't one of those creatures, they don't have an alignment subtype, and they are very definitely therefore rehabilitatable.

Jakuskrzypk,I agree with some of the other guys. Corporal punishment the only time sentence is the hunger dungeon. If you are not familiar with the concept. DISTRACTED BIT Mediaeval towers do not have a door at ground level. Usually the door is set in the middle with a wooden staircase. Why is that? Because this makes it really fucking hard to enter the tower. You brake the staircase and wait for your Bros from the next castle over to aid you hoping you won't run out of water before. Well there were also obviously no windows or shooting slits below the door. So what was below the door? Nothing a big empty room. You threw a heathen in there and that's it. Problem over. DISTRACTED BIT OVER.
 Well anyway you can arrest the person for some time. You can hold the person for interrogation *cough torture cough*. But prison time is pointless. Inefficient! I mean you have to feed him and build a prison.  Pay people to guard them. No we need something that makes for fast justice and a lesson. You can't steel purses of merchants with fingers broken to splinters. If your loaves are to light maybe your pinky for a necklace will remind you to not to cheat and don't bullshit about the bread drying. A stake up your area will make a straight citizen out of you.

JohniiMagii,This raises an interesting question about prison in general.

Would the sentence be punitive or focus on rehabilitation? Ideally you want both, enough punisent to deter and enough rehabilitation to help people.

For a short sentence, I think it'd be the same length. The punishment isn't the life wasted, it comes from what you miss out on. Missing thirty days is a lot, whether you live for 60 or 180 years.

Longer punishments would be very rare back in the day, as execution was popular. But if you wanted to do it, I'd say longer punishments would be somewhat proportional. An elf wouldn't get five times the length as a human, but maybe two and a half times.

Fines might also be proportional. An elf has more time to accrue wealth than a halfling.


  ======= 

script ====164
Rebuta,Depends if the sentence is meant to rehabilitate or punish. 


  ======= 

script ====165
FireReadyAim,I depends a ton on the area and the setting.

Sentencing based on impact to the convicted is a fairly enlightened position to take - one that would probably not be common in most D&D settings.  Generally any crime that would receive a long sentence in the modern world would result in a quick drop and a sudden stop in a medieval setting.

If the city they committed the crime in is known to be fairly progressive and tolerant then maybe it makes sense.

Like Orcs and Half-Orcs getting tougher jail sentences than other races in Human or Elf majority lands for the same crime. That being said, if it is a truly fair punishment it would be the same term no matter what because 20 years in jail may not mean as much in terms of the life of a longer lived race, but it is still 20 years living in conditions that they would probably not want to return to, if they don't break out because they're PCs that is.

script ====167
rising_moon,Yes. But apart from fairness due to longevity, humanoids in DnD are racist as shit. So an Elf might get a longer sentence because, "they live longer and it's proportional," when really it's because humans of that city hate elves. And likewise Orc's might get a longer sentence, but it will be because, "sentencing is different if you are not a citizen." But really it's about racism.

JosephND,Length shouldn't depend on a race's lifespan, it should be proportionate to the governing area's lifespan. 

If an elf commits the murders in a dwarves city, then their rules would be enforced. They would usually sentence other dwarves. If dwarves see elves as animals, they would be put down instantly.

script ====170
Quantumtroll,I wouldn't give them time in prison at all, especially for a crime such as that. Maybe they'd be held in a prison while the judgment is worked out, but the sentencing would be within a week.

Some medieval societies would punish regular people ("nobodies") with death pretty quickly. If your characters are important, the sentence would typically be reduced to a fine according to the worth of the people killed, slavery, the deaths of friends and relatives in proportion to the worth of the people killed, or a combination of the above.

skywarka,Best post title ever for the purposes of confusing everyone.

Regarding your actual question, I think jail sentences should be based on the lifespan *of the primary race making the law*. In the case of an idyllic balanced multicultural society it might become based on the race of the convicted.

I think the length of sentence being based on the lawmaking race can lead to really interesting/scary/funny moments. You might get 50 years for stealing an apple from an elven fortress, but only 2 years for murder in some homebrewed short-lived race's city.


  ======= 

script ====173
Saerain,I would think not, at least based on our real-life sentences not scaling that way according to age. However much time you have left, it's presumably experienced at the same rate, yeah?

It would certainly make for an interesting point of difference in law between kingdoms, though. Let's say particularly a human region that's totally not deeply bitter about the lifespans of other races.

script ====174
apepi,I actually think it may actually depend more on who is giving the punishment rather than who does it. A village of Elves might have a different one than Humans or Dwarves. Unless it is a multicultural village/city than you think most of the laws would be written according to their race.

dethtroll,I would always consider the race doing the imprisonment. Elves for example may imprison one of their own but see the shorter lived races as a burden to keep imprisoned and just execute them. But humans on the other hand are know to be very meticulous with records and lineages so they may keep records on long lived raced prisoners to ensure justice is served even if the person who issued the sentence passed centuries ago. I'd ultimately leave it to how you want to rule it for your campaign and pcs. .

RuneKatashima,Proportional crimes make sense, but also consider the rationale of those indicting them.

If you have Elves doing it they might sentence even short-lived races for a long time.

I mean, 20 years away from the world might be enough for it to change so drastically that it's gonna be entirely different reality. 200? You're almost literally entering a different setting now. ;]

miniPhil,Although it may feel gamey the punishment should effect them mechanically above all else. You don't really want to encourage mass murder among your players. While death has been suggested I feel this may be looked at as an opertunity to start fresh( character creation can be quite fun). 

Instead mutilation/torture should be used to reduce stats. They should become infamous in the event of an escape to make resources hard to come by. Finally all  non magical gear destroyed, while magical transported elsewhere. How many you use is up to how light hearted your game is. 

Obviously we need to give them something(this is dnd after all) and quests work great. An evil faction becomes interested and tries to recruit them. A high official sends them on a suicide squad esq task. Another prisoner needs a mcguffin stolen/retrieved/transported and will pay good money for a break out.

sirblastalot,In a medieval setting, prisons weren't as much of a thing.  For minor crimes you'd be punished by humiliation (being branded, put in stocks, etc.) or corporal punishment (flogging, having a hand cut off.)  For something as serious as mass murder, they'd probably just execute you.  The only time you'd keep someone imprisoned would be when they were a politically important hostage, like a captured noble, in which case you'd keep them until their ransom was paid, you achieved your political goals, or you got deposed and the new ruler said "why are we feeding and housing this guy?"

Twilightdusk,I'm sure this has been said before, but unless the people in charge have reason to be lenient (didn't like those guys you murdered or something), the prison sentence is probably "However long it takes us to get the gallows / guillotine / etc. set up" Unless you're specifically playing in some kind of society that's opposed to the death penalty.

kilkil,I think it would make sense for some sentences to be extended to account for elves and dwarves for example, but not all sentences. For example, a 1-year sentence would remain a 1-year sentence, whereas a longer sentence (20 years) might be stretched out to accommodate elves' and dwarves' longer lifespans.

There's also the possibility of discrimination. A half-orc might get longer sentences just for being a half-orc, for example.

And finally, there are player classes. Maybe a Paladin gets a life sentence for breaking their Oath?

ThisIsAnApplePancake,Depends on the society that is imprisoning them and if the party members are willing to throw each other under the bus and how corrupt the local city is.

Example, I ran a game where my players TOTALLY derailed my intended game plan by murdering a bunch of dwarves in an underground city.  Now one of the party members who basically instigated it was a dwarf.  However, during the trial he blamed everyone else and on a very lucky charisma roll he convinced the magistrate that it was everyone else and he was terrified for his life.  

He got let go.  Then the rouge escaped.  And together they slaughtered the guards and let the prisoners out ho would have gotten the axe the next day.

You can make an adventure out of your party totally fucking it up.  Have fun.


  ======= 

script ====222
Abstruse,It depends on where you are. If it's an area that's mostly human, odds are they'd have sentences on human lifespans. Elves would have sentences based on elvish lifespans, dwarves based on dwarvish lifespans, etc. Depending on how xenophobic the area is, they may make an exception with stronger/more lenient punishments because of that.

However, areas that typically have a large, mixed population (thinking of areas like Waterdeep) would have some sort of system in place respecting the typical lifespan of someone.

However, one thing to remember is the idea of "imprisoning" someone is a relatively modern one in our world. In the eras of history that D&D draws mostly from, people were only held until their trial at which point they would receive their punishment - be it a fine, lashes, time in the stockade (a week chained up in the town square to be abused by the village), loss of a hand/eye/etc., things like that. The idea of incarceration as punishment didn't start until around the 18th century in the Western world.

But we also didn't have fireballs and dragons in 18th century Europe, and reliable firearms are older technology than the rapier, so screw it, do what makes sense for your world.


  ======= 

script ====223
Throw_AwayWriter,It depends on how you want your prisons to be structured. Are there there for rehabilitation of criminals or punishment of criminals? If it's a rehab prison, they could have a different term limit. Essentially staying there until deemed fit to be a functional member of society. Could be lauded out to a prison town where everyone there is a prisoner. They all work the fields, build houses etc. Part of the term would be learning skills that let them be a peaceful member of society, but also they would need to show a genuine change in behavior and show remorse. The entire thing could be run by clerics if a God of forgiveness, love, or whatever.


A punishment prison would be similar to a deep mine with uncomfortably hot tempurature. No policing, no sunlight. Just sweating and working until you die or finish your sentence(but let's be honest no one ever finished their sentence) when you slow down you get the lashes. The first time you speak out, they cut your tongue out. There are no books, religions, anything. The hierarchy is you and the other degenerate scum besides you and the wardens above you. As far as you're concerned they are you're gods now, they choose when you eat, if you eat. They choose if you receive aid. I'm inviaioning the whole thing run by hobgoblins. You work for long hours but you can't tell how long because you haven't seen the sun in weeks. At the end of the work shift you are all corralled in a large holding pit until the next shift. Then the guards could easily use the "we'll see, you received 90 days for public drunkeness, but that's based on aarakocra time(it's not) and your an elf so let's see here(does bs calculation) that's 50 years of your knife-eard ass being here."

SoundandFurySNothing,Each race probably has laws that cover each crime. The city may give an Elf criminal a trial by Elf law. Alternatively laws don't need to make sense and maybe they need to be updated in the game world. Beurocracy is flawed in the real world and it should be in the game too. So perhaps if an Elf finds themselves in human prison, the laws don't account for other races yet so he gets out with a relatively shorter sentence. You could also add racism, which I thought you might be asking about. For instance The local Dwarven Duke has been fighting Orcs since he as a boy so he made capital punishment illegal for all races but Orc and Half Orc.

lastrideelhs,Totally didn't see what sub it was since I was browsing the front page and got totally confused. 

To answer your question though. I want to say just a set amount of time, but thinking it over I would say proportional to each race. Just because if you think about it. A year for a human (old is considered at 53 years) is a lot longer of a time than a year for elves (old is at 263 years). This being based off of this [chart] (http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD3e:Age,_Height,_%26_Weight). Now from a DM POV it is always up to their discretion. If they want the story to move along at a bit better of a pace, it's fine to just say a predetermined amount of time that is universal across all races. 

Interesting idea though. Haven't thought of anything like this before.

Tim_Burton,That title. Holy crap.  

Yea, I think that's totally fair. When you think about it, a punishment is supposed to be fair/same for everyone. But, like you said, 20 years is a LOT for a human, but nothing for an elf.  

The point of punishment is to serve as a reminder to the offender, and to the rest of society, that society frowns upon certain actions and that the authorities have the power to enact upon those who violate what society deems sacred or lawful. The punishment should strike the same amount of fear into everyone, no matter who you are or what race you are.  

It's sort of like how people IRL want traffic violation tickets to be based on the violator's income rather than a flat fee. If someone with a low income makes an honest mistake, like driving 5 mph over the limit, and encounters a super-strict cop, then that person might not be able to afford the ticket. However, if a rich person blows through an intersection and gets fined, they won't learn from it because they can just afford to pay off the ticket without any thought about it. Or, how Bernie wants to tax people based on income rather than a flat tax rate.  

Likewise, I would even fine people in DnD based on their current wealth (as registered with the local bank - don't send a tax man to count how much gold is in their treasure room)  

At the end of the day, everyone has to feel the same 'weight' in terms of the consequences, so doing punishment terms in proportion to a certain factor is a good way to approach it.

ExiledinElysium,This is a fantastic sociological thought experiment, but might yield a terrible legal system. In a game, it would be interesting to have one country that's trying to be "fair" by having a proportional punishment system, but for that to be the norm across multiple countries would be weird. Also, your game world probably already makes the question moot. Except in the biggest cities, the local constabulary of any time doesn't have the resources to imprison people for any length of time, so most crimes are probably punishable by immediate fine, stockade, or death. A town needs its entertainment. The idea of a "life sentence" as a punishment would be ridiculous to a medieval society. The only people you keep in prison for that long are those who are worth more alive than dead (i.e. political prisoners).

karthanals, It should be based on crime, no matter what the race. The thing is, that the length of time for these creatures lifespans does not matter when it comes to their own punishment. Race only matters when it comes to the city that you are being punished in.

If you are being tried in a city of humans, then humans have their own set of time lengths for serving a sentence. Same goes with elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc.

So if they are all being tried in front of humans, then a punishment of mass murder can be 25 years to life, for elves they would flavor it to maybe 200 years to life. That's why it sucks to be human and to be caught with a crime in one of these cities of magical folk, because the punishments are much more severe in respect to time.

Scary_Goat,I didn't realize what sub this was in.

Whew.

I think that would depend on the type of society the players are in. Generally despotic places might do so, or places with a level of dislike for specific races. Maybe the good and fair Kingdom of Whereverstien borders on Orcish territory, and therefore judges those with Orcish blood a little more harshly. 

Or maybe they value the fact that they're good and fair a little more and try to avoid that.

protestor,Having prison sentences as an universal punishment is a relatively recent thing in real life (a relevant book on this topic is *Discipline and Punish*). I think that a medieval fantasy should probably not have a large prison population, or it would start resembling modern society.

half_dragon_dire,Prisons, even ones where you just chain prisoners to the wall, cost money to run. Guards need to be paid, food produced, and manacles replaced. There is a reason that long-term prisoners in pre-modern times were generally nobles or other political prisoners too valuable to kill. There would have to be pretty significant reasons for keeping an elf prisoner for a significant portion of their lifespan, beyond just "they did a crime and need to be locked up." Ignoring the fact as others have already pointed out that a) immediate punishments were much more common in the past than imprisonment, and b) a fantasy world has potentially much more creative ways of punishing transgressors.

* Amputation of thumbs or hands, loss of sight or hearing, leprosy or other magical disease imposed by Wish or Miracle...maybe there is an artifact gifted by a lawful deity which can impose irrevocable punishments like these?

mark7five7,This actually has nothing to do with D&D at all or more about the nature of crime and punishment.  

To answer your question, I think we would have to come to a consensus about what is the ultimate purpose of punishment.  

Let us say that the purpose of punishment is rehabilitation.  I think this view is a little naive but let us say for the sake of argument that its the primary purpose.  Then we would look at sentences to be the required amount of time to rehabilitate a person of a certain behavior.  Example,  we could say that 5 years is required to rehabilitate a person who has committed assault and battery with a weapon.  

If this truly takes 5 years to rehabilitate then it would not make sense to base it on race unless you could make a compelling argument that it takes longer to rehabilitate a person of a different race.  

This argument is actually not very far fetched if you think about it though.  We say that humans reach adulthood at about the age of 18 or maybe 16 in the world of D&D but overall what does the term adulthood really mean?  It simply is a time where we feel as a society that a person is mature enough to make their own decisions.  So it takes a human 18 years to become mature enough to make decisions.  However, an elf spends much longer in childhood which would lead me to posit that Elven children mature and socially learn at a much slower rate.

This slower rate would probably make it harder for them to be rehabilitated.  

Or maybe it wouldn't.  Maybe the extra time developing and maturing gives them a superior ability to learn and adapt to society.  That is up to you to decide.

However, I did say this view was overall naive.  I think the true nature of punishment is just that:  punishment.  We as a society like to see bad people suffer and even sometimes die.  

The ultimate question you are really asking is the true nature of what Justice really means.  No justice system is perfect but I would say that the United States justice system is a pretty good example and one thing that this justice system NEVER does is completely base a sentence on personal factors of the individual (ok ok, you could make the argument that if someone is mentally ill they wll not get the same sentence but hear with me here).  

Let us take a speeding ticket for example,  it does not matter if I make 300 dollars a month or 10,000 dollars a month.  That speeding ticket will be the same amount and that is because a justice system dispenses justice for the crime and not the individual.  A justice system that dispenses justice specifically catered to a person or a group of people is NOT just, it is biased.  

Once you start taking life expectancy as a factor of sentencing it opens the door to taking other factors in to account as well.  It could be a slippery slope.  Also, you would have to consider the change of civil war or rebellion if punishments were handled differently per race.  Remember, if it was relative and an Elf lives ten times longer than human then his punishments would be ten times longer.  Assault and Battery, maybe you started a bar fight and the other guy pressed charges.  A human may get 5 years but an Elf would get 50, this doesn't seem just.  It is actually further penalizing someone for living longer.

Which means Elves kinda chuckle at the idea of being locked away for 20 years. It's basically a nap. Humans are obviously a bit more impacted. Conversely, committing a crime in an elven city might incur a 40 or 50 year punishment as a light crime, which would be absolutely devastating to a human. 

I'd also think about differing the kind of punishment. Humans lock people up because we don't live long and being kept in prison until you're old is a deterrent to crime. Elves and Dwarves with massive lifespans would likely invent differing, more meaningful ways to punish their criminals.  


  ======= 

script ====245
Bear_Cop,I think it should be based on the main race of where you are. So killing someone in a dwarven village would be 100 years, but if you killed someone in a human village, it would only be 20

  ======= 

script ====248
pretzelzetzel,To answer the question everyone on /r/all thought this was before seeing the subreddit, yes. In-game. If it's a Dwarf town, elves get proportionally harsher sentences and so on. Tieflings get executed for crimes for which half-elves receive a slap on the wrist.


  ======= 

script ====249
Sad-Crow,I think this highlights an interesting discrepancy in our interpretations of the justice system.

A lot of people seem to see the the justice system as being primarily punitive. And in a lot of places I think that's exactly how it works. If you commit a crime you ought to be punished an amount deemed equivalent to the severity of the crime. Credit card fraud? A couple years. Mass murder? You are fucked up and deserve to rot in a sunless cement box, or possibly just killed outright.

In my opinion the purpose of jail time is not retribution. I'm not interested in this "eye for an eye" nonsense. Jail time ought to exist 1) to keep dangerous people away from the public so they cannot do further harm, and 2) to ensure they receive the appropriate rehabilitation so they stand a chance at becoming productive members of society. This is why people are released early for "good behaviour." They are deemed safe to the public.
Certainly I think there is a deterrent component to this system, and I don't take issue with that, although I think there is a difference in discouraging "bad behaviour" and teaching "good behaviour," which is far preferable.

In the context of D&D: if we are administering jail time to keep the public safe and to allow for sufficient rehabilitation... then I think all sentences ought to be the same length. Unless you want to take racial stubbornness into account, in which case that is a whole new can of social injustice you're going to have to sort out yourself.

But if we are administering jail time in order to punish (so jail == deterrent)... then yes, I think jail time ought to be scaled to averagelife expectancy, in the same way speeding tickets ought to be scaled to income. That way the deterrent is equal for everyone.


  ======= 

script ====250
ninja-robot,This depends heavily on what kind of time period equivalent your setting takes place in. Modern prisons didn't exist in the medieval inspired time period most D&D campaigns take place in with a criminal being held only temporarily before punishment was dispenses. If the setting is more modern then sure have proportional sentencing. If they do have prisons despite being medieval time period inspired I think local law would triumph, if that means humans get placed in prison for 20 years for a misdemeanor then whatever. Regardless your PCs committed mass murder of important people so they are definitely heading to death row or life. 
Orapac4142,Worked to deathon some penal colony


  ======= 

script ====251
MuramasaEdge,I reckon that Mass Murder in D&D should be punishable either life in prison or magical domination (Effectively making the PCs work for whatever nation/monarch/emperor/administration they committed the offence against) unless they're able to go on the run and escape...if they got caught, then they should rightly be punished but you have options to do that in an entertaining way.

Of course, you could always give them a death sentence...but that's up to you, it really depends on wether those characters can be salvaged or can escape to continue their nefarious schemes.


  ======= 

script ====252
krackbaby,NO! Sentence a human to 400 years in an elvish prison. It would be funny

Or just execute people. I actually prefer the Duergar legal system: If you intentionally commit a crime, you die.

Remnes,And this week on: Subject lines that really need the context of the subreddit.


  ======= 

script ====254
DaSGuardians,While I think this case warrants death (in the D&D setting), losing, say, 10 years of your life is still 10 years. No income, no freedom, the stigma of being a convicted criminal, these all still serious punishments. 
Orapac4142,Yeah but think of elces. 10 years isnt asbig of a deal to elves than it is to say humans or halflings.


  ======= 

script ====255
1Jolly_Rancher1,Okay hold up, why would your party commit mass murder? That could help contribute to the prison sentence.


  ======= 

script ====256
LaserGuidedHerpes,I would imagine that if it's a town inhabited largely by a single race then the sentences would be based around the majority and/or founding race. So a dwarf city would have dwarf length sentences etc


  ======= 

script ====257
zer0chi,That reminded me of one of sessions of campaign I was in. I made a new character and I was suppose to meet with all the other players in morning. All the players were staying at lord's castle. Players made a deal with Lord's son to convince his father to not make him marry someone he doesn't want. One of the players, A bard, goes to Lord of castle's room, tries to open it with force and fail. Guy asks who's there and player answers with "Room Service" and then opens the door with using mage hand, cast Phantasmal Force. Lord succeeds calls guards and everyone is captured (except me). They were put on trial while close to execution they are saved because the whole city is attacked by cultist and they were sacrificing people to summon Azmodeus.
What the player did was stupid but its something to laugh about and make fun of him with it once in a while.


  ======= 

script ====258
Johnnyallstar,Hashtag BlackOrcLivesMatter

Seriously, I thought this was going to be a joke thread, but it's interesting.  Never thought about giving longer lived lifespan races longer punishment. 

And I think I agree on the proportionate nature.


  ======= 

script ====259
Pobbes,I would say generally, "No". Most ancient societies didn't even do jail sentences that weren't just life. Punishment was usually both immediate and permanent through fines, maiming, branding, public shaming, or death. The closes to jail was forced labor or penal colonies (which are basically the same thing). So, in theory, most civilizations wouldn't even have jailed sentences, but any that did develop such a system would create sentences contextualized to their society. So, dwarves would have sentences ranking in decades, elves in centuries, humans in years. 

Those times wouldn't change based on the race of the accused. However, the sentence is up to whomever is the judge for the crime. So, a good barrister would be able to make a case for relative sentencing for a plaintiff of a significantly shorter or longer lived race. Then, the ruling is up to the judge. This also assumes the judge accurately understands the relative lifespans of different creatures. An elven judge might reduce a century long sentence on a human to only half a century not realizing the result is practically the same, but he might get pissed if you didn't show gratitude for his mercy.


  ======= 

script ====260
Anothereternity,Granted I know very little about penal systems. But my understanding is a 20 year old would get the same sentence as a 70 year old. Their remaining life spans are different, so it's similar.

I agree with the comments here talking about sentences being a punishment or for life. I could see a day or week or month sentence in a larger city or until we get over it in a less civilized area, but most punishment would be permanent wounding of some sort, life as a slave, or death.

I think since D&D and fantasy genres have a bit of a basis in medieval (I think?) society, sticking you in a prison until you can be taken out to be hung seems entirely reasonable, and you could maybe incorporate it into your game? Have a hidden door from a previous escape in the cells or something that takes them through a dungeon to escape, or a commotion when being brought to be hung as an opportunity to break free, or something. Maybe if only some of them were caught, throw them in the stocks for locals to throw stuff at and allow the party a chance to sneak in and save them.

I have a character that basically did commit a bit of mass genocide of part a large evil (drow) city, and basically has to avoid that city to not be instantly killed on the spot.

lishiousone,It almost seems as sentences are purely based on race. We see white social affluent rapist teenagers get away scot-free. We also see black teenagers incarcerated for alleged misconduct and are handed a significant sentence in order to set a precedence. Meanwhile we have judges and juries 2 scared to prosecute a white teenager with better access to education and good lawyers purely because they don't want to affect his future.

Citysaurus_ART,It's something I discussed a lot with my players. We decided it was very much the year 201X, you know? We run a fairly light-hearted game, and including the tragic events of the last couple of years would be a real downer, so think of it as equivalent to Marvel NYC or something. We like memes, but not police brutality.

dIGITAL_cLARKE,It's kind of like a shape-shifter.
Nossem,Mmmk 

But what is OP saying with this image?
OracularLettuce,Imagine you're a heroic adventurer, off on your quest to find some sweet loot.

You come across a chest in a deep cave, it is glistening and golden and clearly will be full of that great loot you're looking for.

But then as you go to open the chest it begins to shift in unexpected ways.  Without it actually *changing* you realise that this chest has tentacle feet, and it's not so much a chest as a gaping mouth full of razor sharp teeth.  And its tongue is beginning to uncoil from its dripping maw...

You, hero, were an idiot. You didn't even think about the fact that this sweet loot might be a terrifying monster in disguise.

This image is a re-imagining of the Mimic concept for a non-medieval fantasy setting, where a Nintendo Switch might be considered to be good good loot.
Nossem,That’s deep. Now I see why it’s a crustacean. 
dIGITAL_cLARKE,The Mimic (a creature) can take the shape of something PCs might want to physically interact with, like a Nintendo Switch or a plate of cheese fries, and attack the aforementioned PCs.
cube1234567890,What happens if you eat a mimic?

moonshadowkati,I can't say in video games, but in D&D if I find a mimic I will absolutely try to befriend it even as it tries to eat me. That makes for a more interesting encounter than the standard fight to the death.

Handibot067-2,Why would DND characters ever encounter an “electronics store,” Captain Dumb Dumb?
Robonator7of9,Modern day, my dude.
Handibot067-2,Doesn’t exist in DND, my baby boy. 
Robonator7of9,It kinda does. I'm in a modern day campaign right right now actually."
None,[deleted]
Handibot067-2,Urban fantasy doesn’t exist in DND, Captain Dumb Dumb. Plenty of sci-fi roleplaying genres for that rubbish. Keep practicing. 
BotchedAttempt,Obvious troll.
TheMrShadySlim,Because DnD is just a story telling device and you can make the story whatever you want?

He literally said urban fantasy.
Handibot067-2,DND is situated in the past where no “electronics stores” exist or bazookas. Plenty of game platforms for that rubbish. Don’t bring it here. 
IqtaanQalunaaurat,D&D as written doesn't have anything to do with our Earth, and hasn't since second edition, when Gygax's wizards stopped being setting-active.
Handibot067-2,Why would you play anything beyond Second Edition, poser?  Can’t improve upon perfection. Imagine using a fantasy role playing system to play sci-fi games.  Adorable!  
Handibot067-2,BOOM!  Fist of Wisdom in your ear!  That how I roll. 
PerfectHair,You rolled a 1.
Handibot067-2,On a one sided die!  BOOM! Hand of wisdom in your ear. 
IqtaanQalunaaurat,Shouldn't you be playing F.A.T.A.L. or RIFTS and leaving us alone?
TheMrShadySlim,DnD is situated literally anywhere you want it to be. Obviously no one agrees with you so take your rubbish out of here.

HelixAnarchy,What's with the giant dice? Do you actually roll those, are are they for decoration?
None,Generally those big ones are countdown dice.  The numbers are adjacent to the next higher and lower numbered faces so the DM can count down rounds to some event dramatically.  Unless you give them a huge roll they are very easy to game for a high or low roll (half the dice is all high numbers, half all low). [non-affiliate Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Koplow-14799-Single-Countdown-Games/dp/B001F2S8G0/)
MrHobbes82,One member of our party does. He uses them to compensate for his low rolls. 
DaMuffinTopMan,Do you know where he got them?
Len_Zefflin,They sell them on Amazon Canada.
rattacat,[Amazon has them for cheap](http://a.co/aFhZvY5)

_Lazyland_,I have one of these and i can tell you it doesn't look nearly as big as the dice in the OP picture
Salmakki,I've always wanted one of these, but their being spindown and not RPG style has always kinda ruined them for me :( 
rattacat,We mostly have them as decoration, but they make a good intimidating weapon if the gm has to settle the players down. 
Salmakki,I do have a giant metal D20 that I use for the same purpose haha. It's only 35 mm though I believe unfortunately. 
MrHobbes82,Not sure, I think online somewhere
Kendermassacre,Wil Wheaton?
CreamyKnougat,Our group has ONE giant dice. We call it "Mongo". Almost a mascot.
HelixAnarchy,-Rolls a Nat 1-.

Welp. Looks like it's time to break out the *GIANT DICE*!
TheSpicySausage,Still rolls nat 1
HelixAnarchy,Ah, but it's a *giant* Nat 1 now, so it's cooler.

setpol,Hey can I join your game?

Awkward silence as the table seats x many people.

Joking, but that table is kick ass!
PreferredSelection,Pretty much my thoughts exactly. Very very cool, but I often play with more than four.
HellsquidsIntl,This was my thought, that it pretty strictly limits the number of players you can have. I guess if someone new wants in they have to kill off one of the players. It's the Klingon way (to play DnD.)
Choco316,True, but I feel like a party of four is the perfect size for regular players. Could make a side table or something for guest spots (or have someone volunteer their seat
crashleyelora,May the beer taps be ever in your favor!

judo_panda,This is beautiful. My group is currently looking into a table setup that incorporates the screen, a beer tap, AND mics (for our podcast). 
MrHobbes82,We actually have podcast... kinda.
Motherdarling,Ooh, what are these podcasts? My friends and I are just getting excited about trying to make one ourselves. 
super_kame_guru,The glass cannon podcast is my favorite. Great story and characters. 
TheMightyMoot,If you want an amazing story driven story you should look into The Adventure Zone
Motherdarling,Oh I am all over that. Best god damn show. I've got a bunch of adventure podcasts I'm subscribed to, but I'm always keen to hear new ones. And to support fledgling shows aswell. 
LATE-PROCRASTINATOR,You can't hang this sentence like that and walk away mate. I want to follow your tabl... I mean your group's adventures.

Dixnorkel,I was wondering what the metal grate-like things were on the sides, the fact that they are beer taps makes this the coolest table I have ever seen.  Congrats on the awesome setup, let me know if it's possible to pay this guy to get the blueprints.

Loghery,Things players use the whole time they play: chairs.

Every post with a D&D table: stiff patio and uncushioned kitchen chairs.

if your session is longer than 1 hour, this is killer for heavy people.
 
I don't mean to hate, I appreciate the work that goes into the table and they are really cool, but I just want to see one post with *'I'm going to seat 5-7 people in here for 4 hours'* as the main consideration. 
T_Rex_Flex,Idea: Ultra low D&D table so you can sit cross-legged or on a cushion or on your knees like the Japanese at meal times. I like floor sitting and it negates the need for chairs.
scelestai,I'm saving this idea, I love it. I may make it in the future as chairs suck. Wait, fuck I have a toddler, this idea wouldnt work x.x

rugology,my back is weeping at this idea
T-Minus9,As the saying goes: strong abs or a bad back

*rubs back and winces
TheEyeofOrion,You are correct.
MrHobbes82,Then people can bring their own cushion if it's an issue for them. DM's generally do enough for people. Spending several hundred on chairs that get used once a week seems a bit much.
None,[deleted]
MrHobbes82,Well we're fine with our chairs. Feel free to get lazy boys for your group man. 
Loghery,Does the table have another use?
alflup,Poker night.
SpinahVieh,And so do the chairs.
stokleplinger,Nah, we only stand to play poker around here.
Jt_Cuttinstuff,We use shitty chairs and I end up standing every now and again. I ALWAYS stand for combat, though.
PM_ME_DND_FIGURINES,I can't help but stand up and pace around the table when I DM. I don't know why, but it's gotten to the point where, instead of using a DM Screen, everything I use to DM is just on a separate table across the room to clear up space on the main table.
BlakCake,I've been thinking about this since ideas seems to flow better when I'm walking but I feel like it would be disrespectful to my players and be a distraction

GalisDraeKon,People have these things called 'disposable income' and 'carpentry skills' that I have yet to master. Everytime I try to build something as bold as this, I roll a 1.

Also, I have like 0 free space on my house for something like this. Doesn't stop me from getting a raging nerd-boner from seeing something as beautiful as this gaming table.

__xor__,That is fucking awesome...

BTW I seriously just want a monitor or something which we could use as a battlemap! What's the best way to do that?? I build out all the maps we use with Dungeon Designer 3 but then I just draw them out on a large dry-erase grid thing, which is cool but I lose all the graphics and everything. It feels like such a waste sometimes to put all the effort into the terrain and graphics and then just draw out the layout with a black marker for them.

How are people doing that otherwise?
MrHobbes82,We use roll20 and a rasberry pi
__xor__,Normal monitor, just flat and balanced under the table? I actually have a spare and multiple raspberry pis. Might be able to pull that off.

HumbleBro,I've never played DnD. Seeing this kind of setup makes me want to play. Is DND easy to get into?
techparadox,Yes and no.  There's an initial outlay of cash for the books and a set of dice, which is fairly easy if you have a local gaming store. The rub is that you'll need a group to play with and someone to be the Dungeon Master (if you don't want to DM - and I'd recommend that most first-time players don't). If you have a local gaming store, check with them to see if they do one-shot game nights for new players. If they do, sit in on a few sessions and see if you enjoy the game.

mrgedman,Ya.. I read a lot of "what if everyone pulls at once pressure arghhh"  and that's the easiest part.  May cost a lot in regulators, but it won't be what makes the system suck at all.  I bet running at 10 or 12 psi, you could have several taps open at once with a single regulator, no big deal.  May need abnormally large main Lines, but again, no big deal.

I run mine around 5 psi, and pour most all beers well.  I only have a few feet of line and a few feet verticle, but with the table here, there would be almost no problem pumping uphill..  

Really doesn't take much to get it to flow

MrHobbes82,There's only 5 of us in the group.
wyvern691,But what if more people join?
MrHobbes82,They don't. We have our group.
wyvern691,Do you not have any friends outside of your group that may, at some point, join?
MrHobbes82,Not unless someone leaves or we get more seats. 
wyvern691,That's what I'm saying.  There are too few seats at your table.  Optimal party size is 6.
MrHobbes82,Optimal party size is whatever works for your group.
wyvern691,6 works well for your group.  Trust me.  I know.

BatDick2069,That's what I call it!
Billy_Chapas,But by the American rules this should be called Soccar and not Carball right?
rookie-mistake,soccar is what the gametypes actually called in game, for what its worth
parkerSquare,Presumably because it features rockets and cars, my wife calls it "Car Ball Space Program", which I suspect is a clever pun based on the 1988 rocket mission to send Abdul Ahad Momand into orbit as the first Afghani in space, known as the Kabul Space Program.

I'm down with video games and play them myself but being second to a screen is infuriating for anyone. Priorities dude. Your poor wife.

handsomejack11,This is a lot better than the same ol' "freestyle next to the ball but not actually touch the ball nor guide the ball" garbage we see on here on a daily basis.
SaucyWiggles,Got a mgtow over here!

See? Nobody cares. Nice hat.
Cpt_Catnip,because hot wheels soccer
ocxtitan,Better than yet another simple aerial from someone who "isn't very good but was proud of this one"...
None,This is better than actual gameplay of the game...Really?


ocxtitan,It's a breath of fresh air from the unimpressive "good for you" pats on the back for lower skilled players we always see.

Most of us, well, many of us at least have significant others that aren't themselves into gaming or have a sense of humor so we can see our own wives/gfs/bfs/etc saying something similar and laugh and upvote and move on.
None,If you think none of the shots posted are impressive than i guess you avoid the new page.
ocxtitan,I didn't say none, so don't put words in my mouth. I said normal aerials and similarly unimpressive shots, and I do avoid the new page for precisely that reason.
None,You do realize the "My first arial" posts got popular because a couple blew up big just like this right? 
ocxtitan,And? Doesn't mean I voted for them either, and at least this is different from yet another challenger 2 level goal.
IASWABTBJ,It really depends on the gameplay though, but this was quite funny and relatable.


Maybe the people that don't find this funny don't have a GF (nothing wrong, just a thought), because this is something my GF could say.

PillowTalk420,I'm sure someone will find a way to take the RL out of the player. Then they will kidnap the top 3 RL players in the world, take their mojo and give it to their underlings and try to take over the world somehow... Wait... How *was* the bad guy in Space Jam going to take over the planet by winning a basketball game?
theAlphaginger,I think they wanted the Looney Toons as attractions for their alien theme park.

zoronoaroro,Can relate to this so much right now. I got two of my schoolmates to get Rocket League a few days ago since it was on sale on Steam this week.  

It hasn't been a week and one of them can already go toe to toe with me in 1s. On one hand I feel happy he's enjoying the game so much that I couldn't care less if he gets better than me, then on the other I just want to snatch the controller out of his hand and throw it away lol
Potchi79,I got my kids playing RL after I haven't played for months, and they recently beat me a few times. I feel like a bad dad admitting it, but my jimmies were so fucking rustled. So I practiced all night and kicked their asses the next day. 
ElvisIsReal,>it was on sale on Steam this week.

the fuck did I not know this? :/
Fishbob,Yea dude, don't sweat! My little brother would watch me, pick up on my techniques and become a good partner in 2v2.
gfarwell,+100 iota
HeavyChair,That’s when you just pretend that you’re taking it easy on him lol
Fredde1909,but did you real practice so far or did you goof around. all the time means nothing if you play just4fun.


did you try to control the ball in customs for few hours? did you try to air dribble etc in customs?

NotClever,Halo came out the winter break of my senior year of high school (I think it was winter break, anyway). We had a halo group that formed that spring and summer where one dude was just godawful. It was a running joke how bad he was. He would be the one that every time we killed him he wouldn't even understand what happened. We went off to college first semester, and I don't know what happened but he became a god. We all hung out at winter break and he crushed us so hard. Some guys really couldn't handle it and got super pissed, which was funny.
demerdar,lol.

to be fair, back then everyone was playing halo in the dorms, you could get really good; fast.
NotClever,It was just odd because he'd already been playing with us for like 6 months or more, but yeah, we were only playing on weekends so it's definitely possible that he just played several hours a night for all of first semester.
spali,Nah fam he's just on the accelerated path because he's got a good teacher/sparring partner. 
CashCop,This is definitely true. I started playing Counter-Strike and was silver for hundreds of hours before I figured the game out for myself and eventually made it to LEM+ and got into ESEA too. Whenever I told my friends about the game and they wanted to try it, I would give them tips and pointers by analyzing their gameplay, and they would learn by watching me. Most of them got placed in ranks that I spent at least a few hundred hours getting to.
None,/r/wholesomecomments 

Mediocre_LPC,I taught my 2s partner to play and in turn he taught his friend to play and I played with his friend and got waxed. 
data-crusader,I lost my two's partner to "the other League" :( he taught me how to play and I miss him v much

SrGoodbar,my condelences 
SH4D0W0733,Those who can't do, teach. And teach very well apparently.
sexaddic,Had to hurt. 
Mediocre_LPC,It was a combination of poor chemistry in regards to timing and his rotations are bad to the point of being unpredictable. 
paycadicc,Lol bro I feel you. I've seen players that are almost so bad, they're good because they're completely unpredictable 
Mediocre_LPC,Doesn't help I'm a plat 2 in everything but 1s where I'm a Silver.
CMLVI,Haha that's what I say when I lose in ranked. 

"THEY JUST DON'T PLAY WITH ANY COMMON SENSE. THEY JUST HAD ALL 3 PLAYERS GO AFTER THAT PASS, WHO FUCKING DOES THAT?? THEY ONLY GOT LUCKY. I'M GONNA GO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE FUCK THIS."
wannaziggazigah,I don't play this game, but this sounds exactly like Phil Helmuth when he loses a hand of poker. 
bhoylegendrl,‘Idiots from Northern Europe’
8_guy,This guy can't even spell rocket league!
rootyb,The Hellmuth is my favorite form of shit-talking.
treemanman,Please elaborate??
rootyb,Phil Hellmuth is a poker player that is pretty, ah ... smug? 

He's apt to explaining losses by saying, essentially, "how could I have predicted they'd make such a terrible/stupid play and pull it off?"

/edit: It's a special kind of shit-talking, really. It's about the only good way I've seen to shit-talk from a loss. :)
ImHereToYellAtYou,Sometimes it's hard to counter the giant 3 car ball of death blitz. What's your rotation going to do against the .1875 second 2 car-double ricochet rebound?
TalkinBoutMyJunk,First time I got wrecked like that on a match I didn't know Wtf to do, they executed the wall aerial to goal post rebound so well I just sat there and watched then score. After that I learned to avoid that by not giving then chance to setup. At first though, when you see some shit, sometimes you're just so amazed you freeze up.  
CMLVI,Spam "what a save" because clearly I fucked up here.

ihawn,I have a friend like this. Literally every video game he plays, he could be pro in. I started RL before him. Spent several months grinding to gold. Granted, I suck at video games, but he got to grand champ in like a month! Same with overwatch. I'm having a good 'ol time until HE decides to start playing at which point he passes me up in like a week and gets up to over 3500. Dude is unreal. The sole reason I don't play PUBG is because he started before me so I know he's probably already a pro.
Potchi79,An old coworker/friend of mine could always surpass my gaming achievements. It was a weird dynamic, because I was more knowledgeable at work and better at the job we did (he agrees), but he could always destroy any racing game PBs that I was proud of. I thought I had an edge in other games because I'd beaten Demon Souls/Dark Souls, but then he did the same and got platinum trophies in each.
jimmycarr1,What is pubg?
CommunistMountain,I am kind of tempted to introduce him to Dota 2, in my opinion one of the hardest games to learn and get good at. That is, if he's willing to play that genre.

If he gets really invested in Dota 2, he could sink thousands of hours into it, so you have time to catch up on other games! What do you think?
SubparExorcist,this is why you just shouldnt have friends, works for me
MindlessMystery,I was this friend, until rocket league. I can't for the love of me get good at it. Grand Champ is such a wet dream, far as I can go is Gold on my own.
tjm5575,I know someone who’s like this. My friend is just naturally good at video games. He can’t cook for shit though. 
InCraZPen,I have friends like that. Not to that extreme but still the same.  Sure he plays a bit more than me but he just has the ability to focus on the things that are import and improve on them while being able execute. 

Just remember that it is all relative. I have another group of friends that play halo on a regular basis. I could go over without ever playing the game and probably mop them up by the end of the gaming session. 


kingkumquat,Pubg you'd be on a team you'll be fine
I_am_spoons,This happened with me and my brother. Him and his friends were playing ranked csgo and they were gold Nova 1 and the one right before it. They got me to play it and I started off at gold Nova master and went up a couple ranks in the few weeks we played to MG something. I don't really know the csgo ranking system though so I'm not sure if that's even impressive. They were pretty pissed, but in a joking way.

That was about a year ago and I haven't touched it since. 
Tormundo,Well there are certainly paths to get really good at video games quickly. Study the game, go watch pro video's to try to learn from them, read up on strategies, and learn from better players. 
Lejeune1,Additionally, doing drills and ACTUALLY practicing has helped me in OW. Setting up Ana bots and going for headshots and working on flicking helps. Watching pros is only so much good at improving your muscle memory and hand-eye coordination.
caedicus,I'll say watching pros has done fuck all to help me improve.  Playing the same way the pros play with gold level teammates isn't really the way to go.  Also pros go for like every single possible aerial and hit it exactly where they want it to go.  If I left the ground for every potential aerial, I would end up with a lot more whiffs/bad hits, and a lot more pissed off teammates.
XenoXilus,But in the long run you'd get better at aerials. Practice makes perfect~
caedicus,Yeah that's true, there is a balance between playing in a way that increases your chance of winning versus playing in a way that improves your mechanics.  For the latter, I usually play casual.
ssnazzy,Some people just naturally have an upper level of hand-eye coordination. Probably when they were kids they could beat others much older than them too. 
To be a pro though, there are a ton of people like this who put in an insane amount of time daily to compete. 

There are also people who aren’t as great in games, no matter how hard they work. If they’re super into it still and really smart and strategic, then *becomes [insert game] analyst 
rightinthedome,I'm just average all around, and I feel like a dirty casual
CptSweetCheeksjr,When season 3 was ending I thought I'd buckle down and finally get good and rank up. Never left prospect. I'm pretty sure I'm the worst video gamer alive.
thelastdeskontheleft,There's probably a blind person out there that you could beat. 
None,I have 20/200 vision and still beat people in silver/gold sometimes

Edit: 20/200 is legally blind.
vlees,/u/LOOPbahriz do you play Rocket League?
LOOPbahriz,Yes.


Not so much anymore, though.
CMLVI,But they won't see you spamming "What a save" as you score the go ahead goal in the final seconds to win 3-2, so it's a hollow victory 
thelastdeskontheleft,Solid point. 

Though their is a chance they will quit the game accidentally by stumbling through the menu so you can confuse that as a rage quit and still get that win-boner strong. 
CMLVI,Wow!

Wow!

Okay.

........

gg
KazeEVO,Surely you are exaggerating right? Unless he plays around the clock daily in only ranked, getting to grand champ is almost impossible in a month of game time.
nBdyy,It's really not that tough. Like my career winning percentage after 5000+ games is 60%. So if I were to so nothing but play like 150 hours of rocket league in a month (5 hours a day) and maintain that 60% win rate starting from the worst rank I would easily get to the champ ranks. 

Ranks in any game like this, csgo, ow, etc are just how much you play. As long as you win more games than you lose on average you'll eventually rank up to the top and is why competitive players don't pay attention to them. My friend is a gold in RL because he just does unranked and custom games but when we play grand champ ranked dudes he's the best one in the game and it's not close
skwudgeball,No
nBdyy,Well yes considering i got to champs after 150 hours of play time
skwudgeball,I don't believe that unless you're talking about one of the first seasons
nBdyy,Season 1 is it different now or something? I would always just get placed champ any successive season and continue to play unranked with friends. Never bothered playing placements after season 4
Dejugga,Most players don't *really* focus on improving that much. If you do (and play several hours per day), you will improve rapidly. Effort + Time = Success basically. Constantly questioning your decisions, targeting and fixing your mistakes consistently, pushing yourself past your comfort zone, etc. etc.
Knoxy89,For context (not a brag, much..) I’ve got around 20 hours play time and I’m currently plat 1. I think if you were naturally inclined to being good at gaming it’s possible 
Unreal_Banana,im kinda like that but i hit a skillcap at ~600-800 hours i can't get past no matter the game, be it csgo, osu, WoW, rocketleague, heck even minecraft. after that amount of time i just slowly get worse at the game
LordDoombringer,Probably depends on his skill as a shooter though doesn't it? I played paladins for a few hundred hours before I bought overwatch and almost immediately hit gold rank when I did buy it.
Stupid_and_confused,Gold is average though. I'm guessing at least 50% of players are initially played gold. I was, and it was the first FPS I've ever played.  
AtticusLynch,Well, assuming no sleeping, no eating, no shitting and doing nothing else, a month is about what, 700-800 hours? I got to Diamond 3 in 650ish hours, so grand champ is def possible in a "months" playtime

Surely of course he didn't mean that lol
TNT321BOOM,I'm at diamond 3 with 470 hours. I bet that someone with more natural talent and a good practice partner could get there in significantly less time. Maybe 250 hours or something. However, that is still averaging 8 hours a day which is kinda hard to believe.
manu4ever365,>Maybe 250 hours or something

Definitely possible especially with the new easier ranking ..I am currently plat3 div 3 in 2s & should be higher than that in 3s after I am done with placement match's . Have around 230 hours in RL now after buying it in the last steam sale. Kind of want it to go back to previous difficulty in ranking up though as I feel as if the jump from previous plat 1 rank as undeserved.
PM_ME_UR_LAMEPUNS,I hit Diamond 2 after 275ish hours thanks to my 2s partner on PS4 teaching me a lot and me switching to PC after 150 hours. It really is possible just needs to have a significant amount of things line up. 
elmley,That's sad, I'm almost at 250 and only just got silver :(
AlexKF0811,I found that watch pros playing (youtube Rizzo or Squishy) was helpful... Also lot's of tutorials available to help with the mechanics.
Crunkabunch,I have 600 hours now and am Champ 3; was a season 3 grand champ along with a lot of other people then. I think if people literally practiced drills I.e. Dribbling, aerials/backwards aerials, and the like, they would improve their mechanics significantly faster than by just playing games. However, I don't think it would be fun at all and i agree, it would still take longer than a month to get in game experience to be GC.
PENGUINSflyGOOD,[the first legit rocketeer averaged 9 hours a day
](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/3pcn48/first_legit_rocketeer_with_some_stats/)
iphark,I have a friend (well on steam, never met him) who hit GC after 550 hours in S2 (no boosting)
caedicus,In terms of distribution and relative skill, GC in Season 2 was quite difficult to obtain, but compared to GCs of last/current season they wouldn't even stand a chance.  Not very many people had much more than 500+ hours in Season 2.  Now, everyone is a lot better at the game.  

Not saying it isn't impressive as fuck, but it's a little bit different then saying someone got S5 GC with only 550 hours.
iphark,Sure it's different (and he is only Champ 3 this and last season). 

Do you think there actually are GC's who only started last season? That would be pretty insane actually.
caedicus, If there is, sign that guy up for an RLCS team lol.
ihawn,I mean he plays a lot. But he really is that unreal.
COCAINE_ALL_DAY_BABY,You could go from bronze 1 to grand champ in under 24 hours if you won every game
KazeEVO,Yeah, but I mean thats not a thing one can do after just starting the game.
Abodyhun,Well, some people have inhuman abilities. I have a friend trumping my LoL achievements in a year while passing a pharmacy degree. 
JudgeGlasscock,Yeah, some people are freaks. That doesn't mean you're bad though.
PolarStarTV,You definitely can. Fps skills transfer really well even if you don't have specific game knowledge.
reece1990,Not with that attitude.
Sirrwinn,You're underestimating how fast people can pick games up. I say this because I'm like that. Growing up I would play the games my friends would, and pretty much every game, especially first person shooters and guitar hero and stuff, I would become better than them very quickly and they would always ride it off that I just played the game more than them or nonstop, which was not the case.
DoverBoys,Welcome to u/ihawn's experience with their friend.
Liimbo,There definitely are people like that though. Usually once someone figures out how to get really good at one game they can then apply those habits and practice methods to every game they play. I know someone who got Global Elite in CS:GO in ~1 month of playing after being literally pro in a different game.

s0cks_nz,I've got 500hrs in RL and still can't aim properly. FPS is way easier.
Liimbo,Well he is pro in a game that requires aiming and he's known as one of the best mechanically skilled players ever so the aiming aspect probably wasn't a big adjustment for him as much as just learning the actual game and strategy.

scamlikenewton,I’ve played for two years and can’t get out of gold to save my life.
bendall1331,I have been playing for a year now and found myself in the same problem. Grind my way to maybe one or two solid wins to plat and lose. Mostly in doubles. But I ended up taking a month off and now I ranked in Plat 1 on my placement game (which was a lost mind you). I dunno, I guess my point is sometimes taking a break can be helpful.
ALFdude,I ride Silver 3 like it’s my job.  I’ve played since launch.  I play with randoms 95% of the time which is likely my main issue.  Not that I’m great, but could prolly hit upper tier gold if I had teammates that played consistently.
cobalt26,The trick is to put the controller down when you're playing shitty. Don't fight the cold streak, just do something else for a while.
puttehi,I am not sure which mode you are playing but I encourage you to watch this video: [Rocket League 204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHiTUOKDqfE)

Me and my duos partner watched that video, followed the principle shown and shot straight through a couple ranks, it was basically only wins left and right since our mechanical skill was honed but our teamplay still lacked; easily besting both of our personal bests at ranking. Check it out!
CrimsonGlyph,Play around in training mode for a bit and then in casual games, try to get a feel for when you can challenge for the ball and when you should rotate back to goal. It's really all about rotating.
thatserver,I've been playing for months and can barely stay in silver.
SrGoodbar,you play PC? NA? we can make it work haha
scamlikenewton,Xbox One. I’m not sure if that’s an advantage or disadvantage.
CWeaver34,Hey, I hear you. For the first time ever, I got to Plat 1 div 3 two nights ago. Then I went on a massive losing streak and I'm now down to Gold 3 div 1. 

Yaaaaaaayyyyy...
PandaXXL,I've not played quite as long but I'm pretty much in the same boat. If you're actually serious about improving you need to look at a few replays and work out what it is that's holding you back and then work on improving and practicing that particular skill.

For me the biggest issue I have at the moment is dealing with balls along the back wall and accurately judging bounces. I just don't have the dedication to concentrate on improving plus I usually only play for a handful of games at a time. 
DatBoiDere,Reading backwall bounces requires serious practice.  It was almost like going into aerial allstar for the first time and having to learn to hit those shots.

-

You have to find a good training pack and religiously practice it for a few weeks to really get it.
SativaLungz,I've played since the week it came out and i have never gotten past silver. Granted I almost always play casual, but still..... It's funny when ever a teammate sees that I'm master they get excited expecting me to be Amazing, but i never cease to disappoint them. 
None,I finally took my master name plate off for all the grief I got over it.
zduny,Don't play casual. Play ranked almost all the time (casual just to warm up) and you will get better (people in ranked usually try harder, have better positioning and generally play better, it's almost like a different game).
You just have to put yourself in a state of a mind where you are not afraid to lose rank, it's just a video game after all.
SativaLungz,But Hoops doesn't have a ranked mode... That's my favorite mode
temporalarcheologist,I'm level 103 in ow and only 2000 Sr :(
SchleftySchloe,Level 160 here and was 1200 last season. I'm pure trash.
SaintDanie,hey man, i was level 600 in OW before i moved out of plat... just gotta learn game sense in OW which honestly i didn't learn until level 150-200ish. you just gotta be able to anticipate when someone has an ult and be able to communicate that to your team to counteract. i'm only in diamond so i know i'm not that good but i can tell when a zarya or rein is about to ult and it makes it easier for me to get in position to NOT DEAL WIT DAT SHIT.
caedicus,I've seen 5 stars in Bronze/Silver and played like they deserve to be there.  You ain't that bad.
Stackhouse_,Honestly I think the first 10 qualifying matches really skews things. Ive been mostly the same skill for awhile, and starting in bronze the past few seasons couldnt ever get out of silver(pretty casual play but probably on average 2-4 games a day, not always ranked), qualified the other day and it started me in gold. Im not even sure my win % but I know it wasnt every match, but the last 5ish games were all against golds.   
turmoiltumult,I was stuck in silver foreeevvvvveeeerrrrr. Then as soon as I went from s2 to s3 and got gold teammates  I went s1 to G3 in like 2 days. Chilling at plat 1 now. Silver sucks because your teammates don't know how to rotate and many will just straight give up
Stackhouse_,Right? NEED BOOST NEED BOOST! Bruh if youre rotating right you should have it most of the time
turmoiltumult,No my favorite is "Take the shot!" And then they go for it
Caboose_Juice,I've stopped putting the 'master' rank on display lol. too many people were getting stuck on it smh
court12b,Whats the setting called for that? I can't find it any more. 
jirkacv,IIRC it is the last tab in garage/car customization
Sumo148,It's next to where you edit your player title banner. It's not in the car customization menu anymore. 
TheApatheist,Same, Silver III master ...

Used to be Gold (or its equivalent) in the first season, but then the average just rushed right past me.
Stackhouse_,This may not be your forte but smoke a bowl and play ranked till it wears off. That shit is a PED for RL
PoLS_,After watching my friend play high, I heavily disagree lmao.
Caboose_Juice,Yeah same. Luckily with this latest season I'm in gold 2 and 3, with some luck and a winning streak I can maybe push to plat and get my honour back
altairian,Just wait till you get rocketeer. ;)

I display it on purpose.  Makes it real easy to tell when someone isn't worth trying to speak to when they criticize something I do
jhaunki,Anyone who criticizes based on XP level isn’t worth arguing with. It’s not the kind of trash talking I like to attract so I keep it blank. Though I have to admit I do myself sometimes wonder how some fellow Rocketeers can be so bad after playing for so long. But my standards for bad are much lower, and I would never actually shit-talk someone about it.
scartol,Amen brother. I took Rocketeer off once but I put it back recently. I've started using the following:

* You seem obsessed with my level. I'm concerned for you.

* You seem upset. Do you want to talk about it?

and if I have enough time:

* How old are you? Okay well you've been alive for [x] years. And yet you're still dumb. So obviously there's no direct link between how long we spend doing a thing and how good we are at it. Right?

But that's a lot of typing and usually I can't be bothered.
KarmaGoat,OK I know I am three days late but that last one is savage
This_User_Said,I play League of Legends and I can't even get out of Bronze, and hearing you guys play Rocket League and having easy time getting out is making me want to buy RL. 

Who am I kidding? I have an addiction to toxic multiplayer. Bronze for life in LoL. 
Nuhjeea,I FINALLY got to Gold in LoL after like 4 years of playing. Granted I took breaks and don't feel like I'm "tryharding" as much as some other games I play but I feel like I must *really* suck since I can get much higher ranks in other games in less time.

My "pro" friends (the ones that get grandmaster in every game they choose to practice) tell me it's because I "don't care about improving."  
I mean... I kind of care... Maybe that's a nice way of saying "you'll never be good at MOBAs; stick to shooters or SSBM."  Oh, and I'm pretty bad at Rocket League but don't play much.
This_User_Said,Yeah, I only started a little than a year ago. I try hard when a team is worth, but in bronze that's rare.
StoicStroke,Just farm, get 170 vs by 20 min and you will carry every game in bronze.
CausalityMadeMeDoIt,You have an addiction to toxic multiplayer games you say ?!

Then RL will be like crack for you 
DatBoiDere,LoL is in its own tier of toxicity that RL can't touch.  Trust me...  When you are playing a game that takes 45-60 minutes to finish and one team member out of five can throw the entire game, people reach new levels of rage.
OCMule,My friends all migrated from dota.  We all agree RL toxicity is adorable in comparison.  Makes it easy to just have fun being competitive.  At worst you hear some unoriginal insult for 5 min max.  Easy to tune that negativity out after dota.
DatBoiDere,yep yep
thelastdeskontheleft,Weird that you've played that long and are still just a master. That's not even skill based. 
SativaLungz,>Weird that you've played that long and are still just a master.

Is this a joke? I thought master was the highest 

I'd say Iv'e on average played about 2 matches every-other day in casual mode since July 2015
thelastdeskontheleft,Title | Levels | XP required  
:- | :-: | -:
Rookie | 1 - 9 | 0 - 17750
Semi-Pro | 10 - 19 | 23500 - 151750

Legend	|60 - 73|	5092250 - 9256000
Rocketeer |	74 - 75	|9647500 - 10462750

That's the list of level titles you can get to. 
jirkacv,It kinda is. If you mostly play casual you only get half the points.. And if you lose a lot you don't get points for win, which is a lot. And I also play for like two years, but with at least three huge breaks. 
AshenWhiteHairedOne,The three huge breaks being 5 months each?
jirkacv,not each, but yeah.. in two years I have "only" ~400 hours, and am level 55
InCraZPen,It’s because you can only get so far by just having fun. At some point you have to make a conscious effort. The only game I did so was Counterstirke. You can be good at counterstike by just playing a lot and sure you’ll get map awareness and headshot a bunch of noobs but you’ll hit a cap. 

To get good you need to play training maps. Train with people to know certain timings and strats. Play game after game with the same gun to learn exactly how the recoil works for that one gun. Read up on meta and equipment buying strategies. It’s fun if you’re into it but at 33 that isn’t fun anymore no matter how fun it sounds to be good at the game. 
SativaLungz,Yeah i guess that makes sense. I also change my car after every match, especially now since you can change your car on the rematch screen. I have 20 different presents set up. I'd rather stick to playing for fun. I actually do hoops more than anything
InCraZPen,Fun is fun 
DButcha,In the words of Conor McGregor "precision beats power, timing beats speed, I tell em every time". Now, just be great at all four of those and you'll be fine!
vintagestyles,or get your ass kicked by mayweather. 
HeJind,I'm not sure timing beats speed in RL. I'm pretty sure I could get at least Plat by fast aerialing only. 
Stefek,But if your timing is off you'll whiff or misplace your shot. Speed obviously helps but the timing is what gives you precision.
wubbalubbadubduubs,This is so true. I would also add anticipation into that mix.

The more games I play, the more I can get a read and anticipate what my opponents are going do. Granted if I ever get out of Gold II that will become way more difficult to do, since I presume people will be much less predictable.

OrtYander,He tagged their usernames. That alerts people and shows them the message. 
lilLocoMan,If they have reddit gold, I'm pretty sure.
OrtYander,Used to be a feature of reddit gold. Now it's standard for everyone. 
lilLocoMan,Thanks for replying, I didn't notice they changed this! I don't see the use for gold now then.. but I guess it's more a statement kind of thing these days.
SavvySillybug,The only two useful things gold does is highlight new posts since you last visited a thread, and remember what links you already clicked across multiple computers.

Pretty sure RES also does the first, and the last never worked 100% right for me.
preggit,E&L and I have been playing a lot of PUBG lately although I've been getting the rocket league itch again...
Arsid,What is PUBG? I Googled it but I'm not sure exactly what it is or what you do. It's been mentioned like 3 times in this thread though. 
preggit,It's a battle royale game, you drop onto an island with 100 other people and find weapons/vehicles/ect and try to kill everyone.  There's a circle that continually gets smaller that forces people together.  Last man (or team) standing wins.  
Arsid,That does sound fun! Is it a first person shooter? 
preggit,Yup, you can play first person or third person perspective
Arsid,Oh that's cool. Too bad I only have a ps4 lol. Fortnite any good? 
Orruner,Yep. It's pretty much the same thing.

Twinewhale,It's important to realize that the ranks have moved since S3. Diamond is about the level that Champ used to be in S3. 
tcain5188,Yes i know. Thats my point. If i was this good in season 3 i would have a fancy purple reward to show for it. Alas, i am cursed to remain blue. 

And i know that everyone else knows that diamond is what champ used to be, but i dont care i just want purple shit!

anyonamous,You'll manage. I'm hoping to hit GC within a few weeks. I'm D2 at the moment and I'm being held back a bit but in all honesty... it felt almost easy to reach it - the latter of last season diamon 1 was thick with equal games in my experience. I don't know if it felt easier because it's early in the season, or that I've improved, but if that's the case I'm happy to swipe GC at least once no matter!

I wasnt much of a gamer before the age of around 18. Parents bought me an Xbox 360 for my birthday and knowing my best friend had one, I asked him which game I should get. He suggested I get COD. I was really hesitant since anytime we used to play he, or anybody really, would beat the living shit outta me. 

I was playing game battles within 6 months. Not sure if I was just naturally good at it or just the fact I played that thing for close to 60 hours a week made me good, but he was mad as shit.

GildedGrizzly,Seriously. I stopped playing partly because of this and it was stressing me out.

I’m not very good at RL, I don’t know any advanced tactics, I’m terrible in the air, and my aim isn’t great, but it’s fun and I never played competitive, so I thought I’d try my hand in it a couple weeks ago.  
I somehow got Gold I, I had good games and bad games. I was often told pointers by teammates that I would try to pick up and improve on. But then there were the occasional people who would say I sucked, said they hated me, said they wished they didn’t have me on the team. Those people ruined the experience for me, stressed me out to the point I just stopped playing. I was constantly worried that I was disappointing my teammates, even when they didn’t say anything, and I even started playing worse as I got more stressed (I am now Silver II). It reminded me why I prefer single-player games.
Ron_DeGrasse_Gaben,Mute chat, simple as that 
GildedGrizzly,Wow, why didn’t I think of that! I’ll try that next time, thank you.
aerixeitz,It really helps a ton if you're just playing to enjoy yourself and aren't super competitive. I was starting to get tired of rocket league a few months ago due to all of the negativity. In person I'm a fairly social person, but when I sit down to play video games I'm really not looking to have to communicate with people at all, so I just turned off chat entirely unless I'm partied with a friend and I've begun to fully enjoy rocket league again. 
hitdrumhard,I muted chat for a long time. It helped. I improved. I tried unmuting after a while. 

Mute went right back on. 

Now I mostly leave mute on, but will not hesitate to mute an idiot. Gives a tiny boost of feeling in control. 
GildedGrizzly,That’s a good idea. Because the majority of people are fine, there are just a few assholes who ruin everything

Speedking2281,Yeah, I think it's a good thing to realize.  For you, for myself, for everyone honestly.  Rarely to never is anyone intentionally trying not to hit the ball or score a goal. Being mean to people who are trying is not cool.
whywhywhyisthis,It's why I gradually gravitated to solos. If I'm gonna be ranking down I want it to be because of me, not because someone else kept missing the ball. Still, no excuse for raging at partners.

tonybaby,My skill set is apparently dependent on the play style of the people I'm matched with. I'm aggressive but I rotate. This works well if I have people who immediately rotate instead of sitting around in goal, or follow when I push to center the ball. If you see me burning ass to our goal side boost, get ready to move down the field, otherwise, I'm passing by as I rotate back to mid field. If I'm pushing past midfield into a corner, get to the center of the field and get ready because it's going to be in front of the goal. How many balls have I centered with zero support? It feels like all of them. Also, if I'm in the air perpendicular to the goal, and you're in the air parallel to the goal, abort your fucking aerial. /rant

Sorry, didn't mean to get shitty. I don't shit talk people in-game, but that doesn't mean I'm not frustrated.
hitdrumhard,I feel all the same feels man. Both players following me into the same corner on offense, and the no support on centers thing. 

I am pretty decent at placing a ball in front of net past defenders, but not as good at the finish (I think it is harder because you need to predict the timing of the center) but I try to stay ready in middle.

data-crusader,I got matched with a mid-plat TM yesterday who was struggling something fierce. I remember thinking "how is this guy plat?" And then remembered my very first game as a new plat, which went almost exactly the same way but I was at fault. I was asked "how the hell [was I] plat," which ruined the pride I felt at just having achieved the rank. And to my TM now, I said...

"gg m8, I've been there. Keep up the hard work." And then...

We came back and won! No jk but it was a win for myself and a win for the community. Let's band together to make RL THE best game to play because it has THE best community.
hitdrumhard,Those comebacks do happen sometimes if you act supportive for someone struggling. 

Way more often then being toxic. 

Seriously, do asses like that think they are motivating someone playing badly?

InTheBokeh,This happens far too often... And I play a lot of solo standard.

 If I see a teammate playing sub-par I tell them we all have off games. I can't tell you how many times people have replied saying "thanks for understanding" or something along those lines. I try not to get upset with players unless they're throwing the game.

Also, everyone with "I'm Pro" egos need to chill. I like when I ask, "If you're pro, why are you with us platinum scrubs then?" They almost always never have a good answer. It's usually "My team sucks, everyone ball chases, or no one rotates". Instead, they should look at themselves and ask "how can I help my team as apposed to complaining about them".  I have done just that and have been winning considerably more games and getting less frustrated.  Hopefully my friends will let me play with them after all of this improvement I've done 🙂

I enjoy Rocket League but the community is beginning to get as toxic as the Counter-Strike community.

Hmm... It seems I went on a rant of sorts. Oops.

Nac82,I'm not gonna lie, when I play solo standard I play to make the most toxic player lose. I haven't been playing a lot the last couple weeks (Destiny 2, fortnite, shadow of war) but I think I was Diamond 1 originally. I have given up so many games in solo standard I'm like low gold or silver at this point.

If you are a toxic ass in solo standard I would much rather lose if you are on my team. Doesn't matter who you were toxic to.

Downvotesohoy,I don't get this meme. 
MarcR1122,I referenced [the dark web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web) and the onion brower [general name - [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)) ] because you use onion similar to google chrome to browse the dark web. On the dark web you can do things that would be difficult, illegal, or impossible on the normal web. I was inferring you use the onion browser to surf the dark web to find someone to hack into reddit servers and delete the post.

edit: can't link directly to Tor_(anonymity_network) wiki
send_me_ur_navel,Lol, what can I do that's impossible on the normal internet? It's just an encrypted overlay at heart that still requires the actual internet to function, it just processes IP packets under the covers with fancy looking DNS names
SponsoredByMLGMtnDew,I wish people would stop referencing that meme 2 me.

My name on steam is Tor, it has been for at least 8 years. It was never a reference to **2**E**d**G**y**4**M**e**D**e**E**p**W**e**B**

I've been asked if I'm an onion, I've been called a pedophile, I've been called an edgelord.

Most frequent one is people making some weird joke about onions.. in a really vague..."HEHEHEHE I GET WHAT UR PUTTIN DOWN BRO DEEP WEB AMIRITE???" type joke at me

It's to the point now where I'm like a cashier whose heard the annoying customer's joke  when a barcode won't scan properly the first time at the register and they say:

Mechanon84,This is what happens when you get rid of home ec.
BrixSeven,I had home ec in school. It wasn't presented in a way that made it seem useful or memorable. I remember making chocolate mousse and being shown how to write checks. That's about it.

I think home ec could be redesigned to make it actually seem useful to kids. Don't just teach the skill in a bubble.

* Johnny, your pants are too long, lets show you how to fix that
* You're hungry, because home ec is during your lunch hour, so you have to learn how to quickly make a meal for yourself so you can eat today.
* Let's take a field trip to the store and show you how to pick fresh fruits and vegetables. Pick well, that's your lunch you'll be making for the next week.

Stuff like that.
sachio222,>  It wasn't presented in a way that made it seem useful or memorable.

That's my excuse for failing organic chem
None,[deleted]
BrixSeven,For home ec type stuff, this doesn't require home schooling the kids, it just requires being a good parent who wants your kid to be self sufficient.
iLiketodothings,Our home ec class was just baby raising. Everyone had a fake baby that they had to take care of; most people just left them in their backpack or locker until they went home. It's useful info but also pretty sexist IMO
Avinnus,What made it sexist?

None,the more I watch the less I understand
FoodieAdvice,As an engineer, I became fascinated in sewing. Taking a 2D object and making it 3D was insane.

After almost 1 year of sewing and making clothes (that I wear to work), I still learn new things that make my arsenal even greater.

I never imagined spending 2 hours making a sweater, but I wanted a sweater with sparkles. They dont make mens sweaters that sparkle.
hat-of-sky,Those stitches are sort of like shoe laces. Try it yourself, unlace a shoe and relace it using only one end of the lace. It will work best if it's a loose fit. These fabrics are also loosely knit/woven, so it pulls through easily. And the double thread makes it strong for a hard pull.
None,SHOE LACES DON'T DISAPPEAR WHEN YOU PULL THEM TIGHT
ProfDrCmdrChang,That’s by design. It’s how they identify your body. 
hat-of-sky,If you let the shoe fold in on itself they could. Don't try it with the shoe on your foot, though.
naethn,They do for you feet
TheFallenBepis,It's Quantum space manipulations
NukeML,Huh, makes sense.
lowrads,The concept of *warping* space is lifted directly from tailoring terminology.  [Never heard of a weft drive though.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft)


EvryMthrF_ngThrd,Well, if we consider warp and weft as opposed terms, and we note that most fictional warp drives "work" by distorting the space-time around a vehicle in some manner, in order to protect and provide propulsion to said vehicle (the *Star Trek* warp drive being the classic example); we could therefore extrapolate that its opposite - a "weft" drive - would distort not the space-time *around* the vehicle, but the space-time of the vehicle *itself* in order to provide said vehicle with propulsion - and it *just* so happens that such a fictional vehicle exists, though not labeled as having a "weft" drive: the *Heart of Gold* from *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* series is powered by what is referred to as an "Infinite Improbability Drive", which, by our newly-generated definition, is *certainly* a "weft" drive. 

So, you *have* heard of a "weft" drive - you just didn't know it *was* a "weft" drive. ;)
lowrads,That sounds like JK Rowling level writing.
EvryMthrF_ngThrd,Ouch.

Geofferic,... when you're so white and privileged that *sewing* is magic ...
riddus,I think they were trying to say to be able to just throw clothes away and get new ones, as opposed to repairing your belongings, is privileged.

I’m not sure acquiring acceptable, if not quite new clothing, is a problem in most places in the world these days. I can at least acknowledge the fact that we live in a time when everything is disposable, which is absolutely “privileged” imo.
