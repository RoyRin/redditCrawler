3 months ago I posted the exact process on how I sold $150,000 selling T-shirt on Amazon. I will now explain the exact steps you can take to earn your first $1,000,000 selling on Amazon via the Shopify integration with ZERO inventory.

Welcome to Seller Central
You don't have access to Seller Central yet.

Garbageman99,And is it a big difference on the T-shirt supplier side? Or does it really not matter to them and won't cause hiccups or extra expenses to me?

SoCalWasCal,Followed the steps and got this message after listing my first tee shirt :

"Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated" 

I think its cause I didn't have approval for the category which I now have. Unlinking and relinking the accounts doesn't fix the problem. I'm "active" on amazon sellers... What gives? 


W1ZZ4RD,Heard of this happening once or twice. One went away by waiting till the next day (integration is still new and there are some bugs), and the other went away because they called Amazon.

gbfoam,A friend of mine is a shirt designer. He has been in the industry for years working on sites like Qwertee, TeeFury, ShirtPunch and Ript Apparel. These 24 hour (shirt a day) sites helped him go fully freelance making between $500 - $4000 in just 24 hours. Getting through the voting stages is usually quite difficult but if your designs are good enough to make this kind of money on Amazon you should give these a try.

My question is how much money did you invest to begin with?  Generally this all sounds like amazing advice, yes a little too good to be true, but life's a gamble and what you make of it.

Bassman5k,Thanks for the quality post! 

I took a look through men's t shirts and sweatshirts and didn't see much in the way of non branded options to replicate.

Any tips? I like the idea of your method, but I just can't imagine cranking out and scaling up to as many as 400 designs in 3 months that fit the 100,000 ranking. I came up with some ideas, but their closely related counterparts were ranking at best 200,000 and then at worst 2m in best seller. In the that case, while I could get the product out, there would be little or not demand.

Bassman5k,Also, do you have any luck at all with just tagging hashtags in Instagrams? Or any successful campaigns you ran?

W1ZZ4RD,I can't do everything for you! You simply need to look harder. There are hundreds of thousands of products out there with designs on them selling like hotcakes. This entire method is not just based on clothing.

Bassman5k,For sure, I was just a little underwhelmed with my first look. Looks like Trump stuff was doing well, but you can't scale up on just Trump stuff. Mainly seemed like branded stuff and Christmas sweater ideas (mental note).

Definitely going to peak into other items.

CyberSeeker28,i have a question im hoping someone on here can answer
its related


when browsing around for ideas
ive seen people make mash up shirt designs featuring 2 or more known characters from different shows, movies, or games
clearly breaking copyright laws..

but since they are 'drawn' by someone else and altered a bit, does that make it ok.. and considered 'original'

for example
lord of the rings and harry potter mashup 



W1ZZ4RD,Just do not do it, eventually Amazon will catch on and they will not be able to sell on the platform anymore.

CyberSeeker28,what if the same thing is done...but instead they sale on their own website?

W1ZZ4RD,Lawyers can still come after you. Why risk it?

wolfshirtx,So you can't make a design from any line above characters or anything? It has to be like abstract? 

W1ZZ4RD,If someone else drew the characters before you thought of them, then you do not own the rights to them. Common sense type of stuff here. Just play it safe.

TaoPai,W1ZZ, I'm still a bit confused on how different the designs need to be.  

Let's say I found a shirt around the 100K BSR that is just a catchy saying (not trademarked), no images.  How different should the redesign be?  Let's say the shirt says "Live Life to the Fullest" or something like that, could I take the same saying and just improve quality and put it on mugs, towels, etc?  Or would I need to change something in the quote?



W1ZZ4RD,You can just improve the design itself. If the saying is not trademarked, you are allowed to use it and can put your unique design with the same saying on mugs, towels and whatever else you think might sell.

For a test design it's easy because you can just describe something you know is trademarked, but once you have a design from your designers based on your instruction how do you check trademarks?

W1ZZ4RD,Trademarks should be checked ahead of time at trademarkia or USPTO

On m,y product listing page, it says "Available from these sellers" with a link.  I am the only seller - how to I change this to a "normal" Amazon listing that does not require people to click through to a list of sellers, of which I am the only one?

Bmmaximus,Having the same problem.

W1ZZ4RD,It just means you have a brand new seller account and do not have the "buy box" yet. Give it time and some sales and you will get it. This is normal.

DIRguy,Hi, thank you so much for your post. Just integrated my shopify store with seller central account right after I read your content. Quick question: in your ROI calculation, where does shopify fee of 30 cents come from? To my understanding, since credit card transaction fee is 2.9%+30C and as actual creditcard payment is made on amazon.com, only 30C is given to shopify for every transaction. Is this correct? Appreciate that you are giving these valuable information for free. I've been closely following your work and it's been super helpful. Thanks again.

W1ZZ4RD,I believe that is correct yes!

I appreciate that you took your time to share this info, and I know you from other businesses, I know you have made a lot of money, but is just as simple as follow the given steps and get $1M?

outdoorman555,Great write up. How do you overcome the problem of having your cleaners steal your clients and undercutting you?

localcasestudy,It's not a problem to overcome as much as it is an ongoing nature of any business that requires you to send out an agent on your behalf. Uber has this issue as well. I've lost count of how many cards I've gotten from drivers asking me to call them directly when I'm ready to  take a ride back home.  What you can do is write contracts with stipulations that address these things and hope for the best. I'll say though, as a practical matter it happens a LOT less than one might imagine, like .001% of jobs if I were to do the math.

CrazyLaikaFox,I feel like if you've lost count of the Uber drivers giving you cards it must happen way more than 0.001% of the time.

None,[deleted]

localcasestudy,Look here are the facts:   
1) Stealing customers happen   
2) It does not happen as much as people think.  

The last time I had the issue that was large enough to be measurable was in 2015 and we have done over 20,000 jobs since.  

Don't know what else to say.

localcasestudy,That .001% is my guess for MY maid service.  Note, I take Uber back and forth every week.

outdoorman555,Are your cleaners employees or subcontractors? 

macutchi,As a UK I'm thinking of zero contract hours until the business can afford an employee or do it myself. Or both. 

localcasestudy,Employees.

Boats_Bars_Beaches,Didn't you start out with ICs? I thought I remembered reading you using ICs?

If so, why did you make the switch to employees?

localcasestudy,More control and a more predictable company... things like uniforms etc.

Boats_Bars_Beaches,I'm going to be launching my own cleaning company soon thanks to you and that was one of the questions I was struggling with. Would you recommend starting out with ICs and converting at a later time or launching with employees?

Djesam,Unless you have the money to pay for staff, go with ICs. In our jurisdiction the payroll tax alone is $1500 a month.

TheGentleman23,Serious question as an European: what the hell does ICs mean?

Djesam,Independent contractor. It means you hire them to do jobs but they aren't an employee. 

TheGentleman23,Thanks a lot for clarifying.

Djesam,Anytime man. 

Xaq820,That might explain it. They are secure enough, so that they don't need to steel. My experience in the subcontractor realm (different industry though) is something else.

VicCity,Right on! I'm one of the guys who has followed some of the advice from u/localcasestudy. I started a business and we're three years in and we grossed $400k this year. We're seasonal but I managed to quit my job and I'm looking to expand to year round work. I'm about to sit down and [play a game of Pandemic](http://imgur.com/a/QSrJD) but happy to answer questions in a couple hours. :D 



DigitalMining,Grossing $400k per annum. Can I ask what the profit is?

VicCity,For the first few years we reinvested almost all our profits into the company. We've been growing at 100%/year. If we were to treat this as a mature business we could safely withdraw between 20-30% of the gross without negatively affecting the next season's operations. 

localcasestudy,Thanks dude and good luck with Pandemic!!!

VicCity,Goddamn [chain reaction outbreaks](http://imgur.com/PFutNXo) killed me. 

localcasestudy,That looks fun, will have to look it up! Sorry man haha

dbd6604,When you making the move to Pandemic Legacy?

VicCity,Santa just got this version for my house and we are hooked! I hear it's awesome. 

VicCity,I lost so bad! 

Rhawn,Can you talk about your product costs and reusability?  It seems like you would have to carry an enormous amount of stock to fulfill the holiday time frame.


VicCity,Sure thing. First year I bought $600 worth of product at the start of the year. I sold out really quick and bought another $1000. Then I sold out of that so I bought $2000. I order from a supplier in another city and it gets here within two days. 

I sold all the product to clients my first year but now I've moved to a rental model. 

Edit: forgot about reusability. I buy the highest quality product I can find and it typically will last for a minimum of 5 seasons use. Some product degrades faster but that's built into the rental price. 

Rhawn,Smart. So the first years rental covers initial product cost?  What about storage?  How do you deal with power supply issues?  Ex:  Client's house is already wired to the max and can't handle the load of the lighting setup they want.

VicCity,Rental covers a portion of the product cost. I make it back within 2 years and everything after that is profit. 
I use led lights which hardly draw any electricity, you can string hundreds of lights in sequence. If it is too much I just start splitting up the load onto different breakers.  

imjustaturtle,Do you mind sharing what kind of local service business you run? How did you secure your first clients / employees and how long did it take you to hit 1k/month in profit? Thanks! 

VicCity,We [install event lights](http://lightright.ca). 

My first client was my mum. I did all the labour myself and after that I hired an unemployed friend to help me out. This year we had 12 staff from Oct 1st - present. We stay fully staffed until the end of February. 

We made our first $1k after 2 weeks. 



xfortune,Found this today! How did you go about installing? Examples.. ladders, lifts, rentals, etc?

Thanks! :)

VicCity,Hi there, I did an install at my parents house first to figure out how to do it. Then I got a job, showed up and did the work. Client was happy and I learned more every day.

We used all ladders our first year then rented a boom lift the next year, then bought a boom lift this year. 

wannabehomesick,Amazing! Congrats on the success. I started a cleaning company in Victoria in October. How did you market your business when you first started? So far I've been doing business cards, door hangers, adwords, and CL. Thanks!

VicCity,Sweet, what's your business? I did a lot of cold calls, in person sales, networking events, and direct mail. 

wannabehomesick,Makes sense. Like cold call businesses (or residential?). 

VicCity,Businesses, for residential my PPC and direct mail worked best. 

edit: your site is super nice! How are you doing so far?

wannabehomesick,Thanks! A bit of a slow start. I have a fulltime job that I completely love so I don't devote a lot of time to this. We did a bit over 3k in sales in December. 

VicCity,That's great man! I just installed tawk on my site. Thanks for the tip ;) Let me know if you ever want to meet up for coffee sometime and chat entrepreneurship. 

wannabehomesick,Totally down!

accliftoff,when i saw this post - the self-promotion/scam/dude-tryna-make-a-quick-buck-on-us-wantrepreneurs blinkers came on. but i thought i'd at least do some further investigating. i searched for competition in my area and found a maid business with 5 star reviews on yelp using the exact website theme he has up here. so seems validated at least to me for now. now i don't know how well that particular business is doing - but they're charging a pretty penny and had some customers at least..and have some logos of big media outlets having featured them. so the least we can do is not report this as spam b/c there's so much value here and it seems that people are being succesful using his guidance.

MayBeADinosaur,I really appreciate this. Very interesting, informative and inspiring. 

I have no idea why people are so offended that you're promoting your services/products while also promoting opportunity for others. 

For those who are offended, please realize you can't do this on your own. You HAVE to use other services and products so you'll either be taking a shot at the dark for web hosting, supplies, SEO, marketing etc or you'll take other peoples' recommendations into account. If an anonymous entrepreneur came in and gave the same recommendations, they'd be just as valid as this guy's. He tells you he owns it - he tells you he recommends it - because he believes in it. This isn't snake oil and hair tonic; you have every opportunity to do your own research and validate. Are you offended that he recommended Stripe.com instead of PayPal or Square? Not likely - so why would you be so sensitive to him recommending his own services. Its like walking by a restaurant and being upset that a sign that says 'Best Burgers in Town'. 

Take a step back and realize what this post is about. Read the entire thing and look at what the overall value is. 

localcasestudy,Thanks very much I appreciate you saying this. Thank you.

Techn1que,Great thread. What are the margins? 

localcasestudy,Margins in this biz are between 20 and 30%.  Wide margin but depends on your biz structure, marketing costs, customer acquisition costs, retention rates (you don't have to remarket to existing recurring clients) etc.

SheCutOffHerToe,Thanks for the range. What is the average profit margin among all of the businesses that have used the model you are describing here - including the failures?

How representative are the samples you've promoted? How many have failed or aren't currently turning a profit?

Note: I am not trying to "catch you out" with these questions. This is just just vital information for anyone in the thread considering taking you up on this guide.

localcasestudy,> What is the average profit margin among all of the businesses that have used the model you are describing here 

I don't have those numbers specifically but the industry shakes out in that 20-30% range from everything I've seen.  

>including the failures.  

We have had 1200 folks sign u for launch27, if we use that for a metric for how many people failed vs how many we have now 600, I'd say that we have a 50% failure rate. That's obviously not a clean way to estimate it but that's the best data I have.    

>How representative are the samples you've promoted? 

One sec let me look at the data, will update this in a sec. Edit here is the data. Keep in mind this is across all start dates ranging from 4 years ago to starting just 2 months ago.

5 over $2 million dollars per year  
12 over a $1 million dollars per year but not yet $2 million  
18 between $500,000 and $1million per  year  
23 between $250,000 and $500,000 per year  
55 betweeen $100,000 and $250,000 per year  
65 between $50,000 and $100,000 per year  
76 between $25,000 and $50,000 per year  
73 between $10,000 and $25,000 per year  
50 between $5,000 and $10,000 per year  
76 between 0 and $5,000 pear year  


SheCutOffHerToe,Thank you for your answers. This is key information!

> I don't have those numbers specifically but the industry shakes out in that 20-30% range from everything I've seen.

Fair enough, but that is information anyone could find doing background research on the industry itself. IMHO, when you are promoting specific businesses as successes based on their revenues, it is incumbent on you to either know the details of the margins for those businesses or to include a disclaimer that the margins are unknown. 

You're a successful businessman. You know margins are a big, big deal - especially to startups and businesses in their early years. Most of the entrepreneurs you are advertising to (and attempting to guide) **do not** understand this. If you going to take on the role of being their guide, as you have here, it is incumbent on you to at least bring this up, and preferably emphasize it. (Again, IMHO.)

> We have had 1200 folks sign u for launch27, if we use that for a metric for how many people failed vs how many we have now 600, I'd say that we have a 50% failure rate. That's obviously not a clean way to estimate it but that's the best data I have.

Thanks. You're right, it's a crude estimate, but it is valuable. 

I don't know enough of the specifics of the cleaning industry to know if this is better or worse than average, but it's quite possibly better. It's certainly better than the broader picture of small businesses of all types, which overwhelmingly fail.

Either way, anyone considering joining you needs to know this information going in. Again, it's arguably a selling point for you. If the normal fail-rate for e.g. home cleaning services if 75% and your signups are failing at 50%, that's worth bragging about.

Thanks again for your transparency.

localcasestudy,Thanks for your questions I appreciate it.

clementleopold,How do you handle insurance with this model?

localcasestudy,My model is just employees so we talk to regular insurance companies and get covered. Other people do just business insurance and have their contractors prove they are covered or add themselves in a sub policy. Will require speaking to an insurance professional based on your particular set up

karatelemon,Surely you need more than just business insurance if your cleaners are entering other people's homes? Regular businesses don't have the risk of accidentally burning down a mansion or smashing a priceless vase.

localcasestudy,
>Surely you need more than just business insurance

This is not my expertise, hence I said for this person to speak with an insurance professional.

clementleopold,Okay, fair enough. Seems like a large additional expense, though, depending on each situation.

localcasestudy,Yeah it can be large. I've seen obscene numbers and I've seen numbers that were right around $100 per month. It's really city specific.

seands,Hi Rohan,

I think I have a pretty good handle on online advertising methods, including pay per click, SEO, lead generators and marketplaces, etc.

I'm interested in any off-line methods you've seen working for yourself and students. Does direct-mail work well for this kind of business? How about newspaper display ads? Or radio or local cable spots?

Thanks so much for giving us this amazing contribution :-)

localcasestudy,I have seen people do direct mail (I think it's called EDM) and flyers on doors and in apartment buildings. I personally prefer online but there is a ton of money being made in offline stuff like this. Not radio though.

seands,Thanks for the feedback. How are HomeAdvisor, Craftjack, and other lead generators besides Thumbtack doing for you/students? 

localcasestudy,I've never gotten much traction with any of the others so i ended up focusing on Thumbtack. Have you had success with any others?

seands,A few years ago I tried buying leads from HomeAdvisor and Craftjack for a painting business. I think I was breaking even, but barely. This was with me not doing a good job at all on the sales end though; with an organized process I think it may have had potential.

localcasestudy,Yeah painting is the new rush.  Paintzen just got $9 mil in funding and I hear they're doing well. Same guy from myclean.com in NYC.  Try again and see, I know painting is the new gold rush and it's happening Now!

yousaidicould,Hey [Rohan](https://www.reddit.com/user/localcasestudy). Happy New Year. :)

To give a quick snapshot to /u/seands - EDDM (Every Door Direct Mail) does work for both introductory offers and promotional boosts, you just have to be more specific on the targets and your initial margins. Like any marketing channel, "your mileage may vary." For service-based businesses, it can be really powerful. 

Lemme just toss out some guard rails for EDDM. 

* You can expect a response rate of about 1-2.5% on any reasonable introductory offer that's structured well. Many people set unrealistic expectations about that percentage, but you can pretty much set a watch to how consistent that acquisition of new clients becomes. That translates out to 1-3 people **paying you** for every 100 pieces you mail out. Work out your initial client acquisition costs well in advance and take ***reasonable*** risks and have a plan for risk abatement... Every good entrepreneur does just that. **;-)**
* With EDDM you can get **reeeeeally** specific about your neighborhood - like, *really granular.* This improves your chances significantly. Avg median income of 85-100K for that section of town? High % rate of home ownership? More school-age kids in that neighborhood? You can just mail those neighborhoods that hit your ideal client profile and improve your response rate dramatically. 
* Economies of scale and lower cost of entry do a LOT for you with EDDM, especially if you work with a good, reputable, *local* printer. I've seen costs cut in half by just going to someone local and picking up the flats on your own. I've personally gotten the cost-per-piece down to .25 cents with postage just by talking to someone local and direct, picking up the pieces, and dropping them off a block away at the post office myself. (*That was on ~1000 full color pieces on a test print and mailing - USPS sets a flat rate of $0.176 per piece*)  
* Speaking of pieces (and the USPS) I've NEVER had a bad experience with either the good folks at the post office or the mailers OR printers who know their stuff. Also, these things are (comparatively) HUGE... Like 11x17 in. YUUUUGE. You have a lot of real estate to work with on most pieces, convey good marketing signals and information, and improve your response rate and chances. Keep it simple and clean, make the offer clear and bold, and simple for your prospects to say yes. If you already have a clean, clear, well designed website for your business than most of the design battle is already done, which makes for a really good callback to your site (and your site's call-to-action). 

In short, they work, but only if your initial margin supports it. Once you dial it in, however, it's client acquisition on auto-pilot. It's like mailing people a billboard. Sure, a BUNCH of people are going to throw it in the round file, but you only need a few people per mailing to cover the nut. Like anything else in business, do your due diligence, test stuff, and remember to *aim small, miss small.*

**>>NOT AN AFFILIATE LINK<<**

 - https://www.usps.com/business/every-door-direct-mail.htm

All the information you need is right there in the USPS site. From there, just find a good local printer, either have a good designer or have a good sense of marketing and advertising, and just *ship it.* 

Good Luck and Good Hunting. ;-)

PushBoard-net,Your link doesn't work, can u update?

yousaidicould,**DONE!**

Apologies about the broken link. The *new* link should take you to the appropriate page. :)

localcasestudy,Dude this is GOLD!!! Thank you soooo much!

yousaidicould,For sure, man. It's a privilege to do so, even if it is buried way down into the thread. XD

I haven't participated in the FB Group in a while, as I've been working on two more new businesses of my own. If you like, I can do some sort of write-up or whatever for the group or in here. Whatevs. 

EDDM is only scary because we over-complicate it, or worse, think direct mail is dead. It's weird; we have no compunction about spending hundreds or even thousands every month on SEO and PPC, but hate junk mail...

***... Except it's just like a paper version of PPC.*** 

If you can predict your analog versions of CTR and Conversions, and it falls in the same budget, why not do **both**? Most especially where a local business / market is concerned. 

On a personal aside: You do a good thing sharing this stuff with people, Rohan. I am kinda flummoxed that the top comment on this post is negative, but I gave up a long time ago worrying about people who want to argue for their own personal blind spots and self-imposed limitations... 

It's like that analogy about guys who say that a woman is 'out of their league' before they even ask her out. Let HER say no, don't do it for her, amirite? 

Either way, hit me up. Happy New Year. :)

localcasestudy,>This reads as a easy way to make money but doesn't cover many of the risks and challenges.

Only thing I want to respond to.  Business is risky. Anyone that tells you otherwise has never started a business. It's incredibly difficult, subject to fail, will make you overweight sitting at a computer, will give you high blood pressure and anxiety if you're not careful, and is incredibly difficult to find customers (and shoot have those customers pay you when you're done).  Nothing about business is easy, otherwise EVERYBODY would be doing. It takes an almost insane person to take on trying to make it in the world with their own two hands and take on ALL the responsibility for the livelihoods of a lot of people.  I added this to the thread.  For the rest of what you said. Cool!

We try to gamify this by building incentives: Bonuses for on time show ups, bonuses for good customer reviews, etc.  It's really about building high expectations, keeping the high performing folks and treating them well, and then unfortunately parting ways with folks that do not meet expectations.

And prioritized by the things that will get you closer to making money.  So if you have to consider working on your checkout form or working on your logo, your work on your checkout form.  That's the biggest thing I would share.  Can't think of any stories but if I do I'll come back

Fitness42095,Whoa! Something I feel I could be of use in! I'm a 21 year old business owner also in the local service sector. My company did over $100,000 in 2016. Investing heavily back into the company and looking to double that in 2017. 

TheGentleman23,Great for you dude! Would you mind telling us what exactly you do?

Thanks in advance!

Fitness42095,Absolutely! I'm in lawn care and landscaping. I started the company in June of 2015, I was 19 at the time. I picked up some equipment and have focused on growth ever since. This year I had a full time employee and a couple part time. I've learned a lot along the way, and I definitely have even more to learn. If anyone has some questions I'd love to see if I could help.

JackAttack28,Hey man congrats on this, could I get some details on how you pay your employees? Just an hourly rate?  What do you find works best?

Fitness42095,Thank you! Great question, I pay my guys hourly. Checks cut on the next Friday. This best matches up costs with revenues. I also hold $50 from the first check of the year, as a uniform deposit. This is given back when they quit and return their uniforms or at the end of the season. 

JackAttack28,Did you have to do up some form of contract? So you just pay the hourly wage and nothing on top of that? You are obviously insured?

Fitness42095,Yep, just the hourly wage. I tried an incentive program near the end of this year. It seem to lead to more confusion than anything. I have the guys sign off on a couple of different training forms. One covers general safety and workplace behavior and the other is signed as new tasks are learned. 

I have a general liability policy for up to $1,000,000 and pay less than $500 a year for it. Workman's comp cost me around $2,000 a year. 

localcasestudy,Awesome man, local is tough, but the upside is tremendous if you can make a work. Extra congrats to be doing it so young. If I had started at 21 I would be a gazillionaire by now! lol Good luck dude!

Pabs33,You have a lot of marketing savvy! Thanks for sharing. I'm a periodontist and rely on referrals from local dentists to get patients and create an income. From an outsiders perspective, do you have any thoughts on marketing to local dentists outside of the normal business cards, practice brochure, visit to the office, lunch outing, etc.? 

Gspot_1300135,Hi I'm a chiropractor new to orange county and want to start my own business. Can you give advise on starting your own business? I'm currently working with a company in long beach but want to branch out and start my business on the weekend. We have similar fields, medical/health, and I would love to know how you started and how long before you felt as though you were "on your feet" and had consistent patients?

Pabs33,I think one thing to consider is the demographics.  I practice in a pretty rural place in the midwest, so Orange County wouldn't be a fair comparison. There aren't many periodontists in my area vs. in Orange County I bet there are a number of chiropractors. So I'd figure out a way to stand out. One thing I remember during dental school was a chiropractor coming to present during lunch, and he talked about the importance of posture, ergonomics, etc.  That could be a huge niche if you live near any dental schools or hospitals. Drop off cards/brochures/coupons to any dental offices in the area.  Almost all dentists have some sort of back/neck issue.  Plus, they usually pay their bills! 

Gspot_1300135,Thank you for this great information

localcasestudy,I would become a thought leader in their eyes by creating solid content around general dentistry, customer care, customer acquisition, how to generate referrals from each client, how to improve pricing etc.  Like I would create such solid content you would become the man....i.e content that helps them.  Then as the dentists in your areas become avid readers of your blogs/videos etc. you then set up a monthly "Double Your Dental Business" workshop (or whatever they would like).  As an outsider this is how I would approach this. Give, give, give, give, give, until you can't give anymore, and then create in person events for multiple dentists that cement your professionalism and knowledge in their eyes. I made all of this up though, I know nothing about the dental industry, but this is how I would approach this :-)

Pabs33,For not knowing 'the biz', I'm impressed.  I like it a lot.  Basically, take the approach of how you can help them and "not me" approach.  Thank you for your thoughts!

localcasestudy,Yeppers...good luck and hope you have a killer 2017 in your biz and in life!

herropeepol,I'm going to follow through on this and see how it works out here in the UK :P

My area of expertise focus around IT, so it would be sensible for me to guess that this would work out with something like "Local computer repairs"?

Does your Launch 27 support UK users?

In the UK we have something called a zero hours contract which is where I can hire workers but am not obliged to give hours, only if the work becomes available, would you say it's worth my while building up a list of team members real quick before commencing with this?

localcasestudy,UK is fine yes.  I wouldn't focus on building up too many folks until you have an idea on customers. I would find customers, work on the first few until you figure out logistics and what works and then start to slowly hire people.  I would do website first, get customers, handle them yourself, and then move on to building out the company

herropeepol,Cool, I'm going to start now (doing a Computer science degree at the moment so web side of things I can get done all tonight to be honest).

1ceyou,A quick question, does launch27 offer an affiliate program.. thinking about it now my area has a lot of mom&pop businesses, lawncare, cleaning, etc, etc with very amateur websites. 

I was thinking about offering a complete SEO package + using launch27s theme's and backend.. is there something I can offer?

localcasestudy,Yes it does, can you hit up support@launch27.com someone will help you with a link

1ceyou,Hey there, hate to bother but I sent an email a day ago and talked to your chat on the website still haven't received any notice about affiliate links?

localcasestudy,Sorry here is the affiliate link: http://launch27.leaddyno.com/

1ceyou,Much appreciated, reading the material

Launch27's affiliate program offers a 35% commission on the first month's payment of a new Launch27 subscription. Launch27 pays out quarterly. 

Am I correct in understanding that I only receive payment for the first month only? Or if the customer is reoccurring do i get paid every month?

localcasestudy,Yes, you're correct that it's for the first month only.

Revelation_X,What's preventing your employee (who are essentially contractors, if i'm not mistaken) from making deals of their own on the side? IE: They get a cleaning job through your company, talk with the home owner and agree upon the owner paying less directly to your employee. The home owner tells your company they no longer need your business. Everyone benefits but you.

I'm considering trying something similar, but I've seen other companies fail in this manner.

I follow you on Facebook too. Exciting and motivational stuff. I do a different kind of business. Hate to say it, but we were building a launch27.com before you released yours. The customer slowed the project down, yours was released and it was obvious that you had built a better project.

In the end, it was obvious that we needed to stop on our path and let you roll with yours. I bet that customer is on your product now. Not going to out them or check though...

With all this intersect I might actually work on my side hustle. 
I'm not interested in a local service business, but ever since i had a really bad cleaning experience I paid premium dollars for, I've wanted to build a quality control app for service industry providers. Would help maintain a regular process and help with client approval/feedback on the spot or via email after the fact. 



lalib,Sounds like Angie's list to me, which just went free to join a few months ago.

bannerloo,I like your business model. I do something similar. 

I rank local lead gen. sites on google, and sell the leads to local business owners. I find it more simple since I take care of the marketing part, and the business owner does what he does best. 

No need to deal directly with the service being offered and after the whole system is in place, it's just a matter of checking up on it once in a while and send monthly invoices for the leads generated.

KiwiSi,You do what?

bannerloo,Sell leads to local business owners by ranking on the top spots of google for a specific local service. Ex: plumber in houston

localcasestudy,Yep I used to do this.  But I'd rather the extra pain for a larger piece of the pie.  Your stuff works well too though, most def.

Scizmz,Maybe I missed it.  But you have NOTHING on here about licensing and registering the business with local, state, or federal governments.  There's no section on the mountains of paperwork that you need to file to do this, insurance that you'll need when sending people into other people's homes or any of the other dozens of costs involved in an endeavor like this.  

localcasestudy,>Maybe I missed it. But you have NOTHING on here about licensing and registering the business with local, state, or federal governments.

Does a guide on dropshipping or affiliate marketing or Amazon FBA, or shopify ecommerce, also have to include everything up and include  licensing/incorporation and on and on up until tying your shoe-laces?  These are things people have to figure out, I'm no expert in any of those things and certainly can't speak to them for all states, countries, cities, services, and personal situation of everyone here. Happy New Years

JackAttack28,I was wondering if you COULD shine some light on this as im trying to start up and feel like im getting a little lost in the process. I checked my local business license info and I think I only need a minor home license as I will be going to other peoples houses.

SolGuy,I have a couple of questions, I will use maid service as an example of a local business.  How do you determine if the market is saturated? I checked yelp for my local area and there are about 300 maid services within the county.  It is a large market, 2 million people in the county and average of 100,000 per city. Do you have any information on when not to start a particular business, when is it too much competition? Do you have any resources on density of businesses (if that is a thing)? How much would Race/Ethnicity matter? 

Anyway, love the post and it has me excited to start a local business unlike most other posts I have read. Keep up the great submissions.

*Edit incorrect population number

localcasestudy,Thanks very much, glad you like the post.  I'll repost what I said about competition:  
Think taxis, there are hundreds in every city. And think Uber coming into those cities and competing with Lyft and both of them taking market share. And there are tons of taxis in every city, soooo much competition.  Yet it makes no difference.

That's what we do on a smaller scale. We bring Uber/Lyft type technology and convenience: online booking, credit card payments, account creation, mobile app that shows teams on the way so the customer can know, and a ton of other things that 99% of other companies do not have available for customers.

So you have to appraise the competition by the quality of that competition. Most of the companies in existence are so old-school that the gap between them and us is even larger than the gap between taxis and Uber.

SolGuy,That is a superb comparison, thanks.

rymackFI,Reading this thread a little later than most people.  If you are still answering, I'm curious about this.

What happens with scheduling?  If you promise someone a date for it to be done and the other company you hire can't get to it then?

Do the people you hire ever have issues with going to do the work and realizing the customers are paying you more?

localcasestudy,>Do the people you hire ever have issues with going to do the work and realizing the customers are paying you more?

No. This is the essence of business. 

>If you promise someone a date for it to be done and the other company you hire can't get to it then?

Reschedule.



rymackFI,Thanks for the quick reply.  I've been thinking about doing some web design on the side.  Currently do some programming in my current job.  

One last question I saw didn't get answered early, do you usually switch over domains for the businesses you create sites for or do you get their domain information and work with that?

localcasestudy,I don't create sites for businesses, we sell wordpress themes as a side business but we don't do anything with the purchaser's domains.

rymackFI,Sorry, replied to the wrong person.

localcasestudy,Ahh gotcha! : -)

TorsoPanties,How do you establish the rate between yourself and the other business? 

localcasestudy,That comes down to negotiation.  You can start with what they need and then add what you need on top of it and see if the market supports that price.

Xdxddxddd,Hey everyone, since this is a thread about starting new business I thought I may ask here instead of starting new thread. I hope that's okay.
About two weeks ago I've finally decided to start my own company. I am a backend web developer with 5 years of experience. I do feel confident enough to start my own company, when it comes to skills. Speaking of business side of this idea, I've been reading a lot for the last couple of years. Also my wife has been tremendously helpful, always pointing out things I've missed or had wrong idea about. I've written my business plan, and I know who do I want to target. Taking advantage of the fact, that the city where I live is full of tech startups - I want to reach out to those entrepreneurs and offer them help with backend of their services/ mobile and web applications/ automation/ API's and server side. I am experienced with recent technologies, frameworks and trends in this area, so I'm sure I can provide a satisfactory service to my potential customers. The only thing I am not quite sure of as for now is how to reach these companies. I live in Hong Kong, and websites as YELP, Craiglist and others are not really popular here. Also, I can imagine that advertising B2B is very different from B2C advertisement. I've found this website, listing most recent and trending startups in here, and I was thinking about sending them emails with an offer? I am surely going to attend numerous entrepreneur meetups and conferences. I have a website and business cards. I have so many questions and I do not expect you guys to answer all of them, but I hope I can get some advice and/or tips on how to get into that field as a one-man suit company? I am not excluding possibility of collaborating with one of my front-end web designers friends, to be able to offer a wider variety of services, however I mostly want to focus on a back end side, as that is my specialty, and something I feel most familiar with...

Thank you a lot!

raveraspberry,Long time lurker here. I have a question, and I know the immediate answer might be 'don't bite off more than you can chew!' But for someone who is confident that they could replicate this case study multiple times and wants to incorporate multiple service oriented businesses, how would you recommend tackling that? For example, would you buy multiple domains and then eventually combine them or start with one, and simply add to it until it encompasses everything? Any other advice in this area? Congrats on all your success and I hope 2017 treats you well! 

localcasestudy,The only answer is "don't bite off more than you can chew". One service in One city. Make that work and then you can go allll out :-)

raveraspberry,Thank you! One more question: under COSTS, you list the website theme as $450. I looked at the link and I have a theme in mind, but I'm realizing that it doesn't encompass everything I need or want. After looking into the launch27 Tweaks, it would cost $1000+ more on top of the $450 to have all the features that are either strongly desired or framed as necessary from the jump. I'm struggling to see why each added feature alone is anywhere from $150 to $600 a pop. I know starting a business takes some capital, but in lieu of wanting to break the bank, would you recommend looking into free or cheaper software alternatives, or perhaps becoming more fluent in code?

localcasestudy,>  all the features that are either strongly desired or framed as necessary from the jump.

Do you 1) pay maids a regular salary, e.g. 40 hrs a week or 2) give contracts/jobs to maids as soon as you receive them from the clients you find?

When do you create a name for your business, register your business, get business bank accounts, and all of that stuff? Or am I looking too far ahead into the future and that'll happen in month 2? Thanks for the help!

localcasestudy,Creating a name for your business is when you create a domain. That's month one.  Everything else is up to you, I personally don't register a biz until I get my first sale.  That's not advice, just how I do it.

Fuzzerich,Hi Rohan question on step 9: building the website. I opt o build a website with features / designs like myclean.com, I assume that 99designs.com is most suitable for setting up such a contest. 

- Will the 99designs themes be designed on a strong backbone and not just wordpress? 
- How will the integration work into launch27?
- What else do I need to keep in mind for the website design outsourcing?
- What backbone should be used for the development of the website on upwork  that integrates nicely into launch27? 

Thanks.

localcasestudy,Hi, so to answer really quickly.

>Will the 99designs themes be designed on a strong backbone and not just wordpress? 

Wordpress is a strong backbone. That's all you need, and that's what we build in. You can build in anything though.  

>How will the integration work into launch27?

You drop a piece of code on the website. super easy.

Not anything else to keep in mind, whatever you build works with launch27.  





Fuzzerich,Perfect Rohan, I will setup the website tomorrow. Is the themestreet.net team still active and ready for support / customization? I really like these three themes and might want to tweak them a bit with their help:
http://demo.themestreet.net/launch27/handyman.html
http://demo.themestreet.net/launch27/bluedream.html

Rohan, thanks for all the help & content you provide. I might ask plenty more questions because I want to ensure that I get the best for e.g. 450.- on a themestreet design and can improve it to make it the number one home cleaning business & website in Switzerland.

I've read this and other posts by you multiples times as I've slowly been making my way to starting my own business.  My partner and I are on day 21 of this guide in particular and we have a few questions.

1. Somewhere in your post history (I honestly can't remember where, it was a while ago) you had referred to your workers as contractors and there was a little bit of a debate about the legality of that etc. In Day 19 video in this guide Dara says she's hired "two employees" and also has "two contractors." Which did you settle on for your personal business?  Employees? Contractors? Both? Why?

2. You seem to send your maids in pairs. This also seems to be industry standard. Can you explain to me the benefits of sending 2 maids over 1 if you're hiring quality people?

3. Will you take a look at my website? :)  If not I understand.  You must be inundated with requests.

dmurthy,Fantastic stuff!
I was reading through reddit, hoping to find some silver lining that would help us in handling the human resource issues that have suddenly come up in a similar business that we run in Hyderabad (India).

We run doorstep car service which was doing alright for the past 8 months. We hired two mechanics full-time who have been with us for 6 months. Things were going smoothly with both steady increase in demand & operationally very good feedback on the service we provided.

Then recently we started seeing demand for waterless car wash. So we added this as part of our service and saw demand really shooting skywards. The mechanics were temporarily taking care of the cleaning until we hired full time cleaners.
Then suddenly both our mechanics vanished along with the entire toolkit & supplies. Customers got pissed off, we weren't able to find cleaners quickly enough and had to pause all services for a few weeks.

We are going back online with a new hiring strategy. Outsourcing our cleaning staff to an agency. Outsourced staff will be trained by us and use our supplies. If any of the staff leaves, the agency immediately assigns a new person. Since it is a low skill job and the kind of supplies used make us unique, hoping this strategy works in the long run.

On the mechanic side, we have improved our candidate selection process and offering better incentives for a minimum duration of employment.

The biggest lesson we have learnt through all of this is always prepare for churn.

beeker1121,This seems like quite an odd post to be upvoted to 1.8k.

I'm planning on posting about my SaaS in the near future, but it's going to consist of about 1% of the post... I hope this doesn't affect it.

If you look at the top posts in this subreddit, not for the past week, not even for the past month... but for the past year... that's where this post is headed, and it's halfway to the amount of upvotes as the top post (1,819 vs 3,572) in just 9 hours.

The thing that's really odd about this, is this post doesn't necessarily seem like the type of post the subscribers of this community would upvote so much, especially in such a short amount of time.

You'll also notice the legitimate top posts have people congratulating/thanking the OP as the top comments, vs a moderator explaining why there's such a backlash to the post... yet this post still has 1.8k upvotes.

Not accusing OP of anything of course because I don't have any proof, but this seems awfully strange to me.

localcasestudy,If you can find any evidence of me having done anything on votes, post it.  Ask admins to take a look. Look at the other 3 posts that I made that made it into the top 10 as well. Dude, I do nothing but post deep content and sit here and answer questions for hours (9 hours as of now). Good luck on everything and let me know what you find.   
Happy New Years as well.

beeker1121,Well like I said, I probably can't find any evidence of it, and even if I could I'm not really all that interested in spending my time doing so.

If you take a look at it though, it doesn't make sense what you're offering.

So each of these businesses, local businesses that are easy to dominate, and I'm sure even easier to do so once you've streamlined everything and hire people to do the mule work for you... each of these businesses has the potential to do $500k+ gross with a month's time of work (a month for someone new at this, no less).. and you're trying to sell people on your SaaS product that goes along with the business idea?

Your copy though just reads exactly like that.. a great copy, meant to sell something the masses, 95% of who won't be able to make it work cause either the idea itself doesn't work, or, like anything else, it takes so much time and devotion that your 30 day promise is a joke (spoiler for people reading... it is). Sounds like you're going to upsell a much more expensive product later on to your customers.

You're obviously good at what you do, but I'll tell you what this reminds me of.

Back in like 2006, I realized (and probably thousands of other people did too) that you could rank #1 for almost any term on Google by just creating a specific page for that term on an authority site that would let you do so (think Cragislist). This would be like me telling everyone I made hundreds of thousands of dollars through quick referral marketing... but in reality this business is not sustainable at all, and the work required to automate enough posts to Google to make it work, the average person wouldn't be able to do without serious time investment.

Wish you the best legit, if you're honest and it is what you say, I apologize. Either way I think people should consider all sides, especially with the mod posting and multiple edits.

Where does the work come in? 

All this stuff is gonna crash around you folks, there is no substance. 


Why don't you produce a product, that is used in other products, or consumed itself? Because it's hard, and being a middleman is easy..... For a short time, then it dries up, and you have to move from place to place, or niche to niche. Good luck.

Atrand,i fix people's computers around my community and do "mobile calls".  it's really fun and i get 70 dollars or more each time I go.  I'm a very frugal person so i dont need millions to live.  fuck, even 30,000 or 40,000 a year for me and shit would be a god send.

I once went to an "entrepreneur convention" meet up thing? holy.....my god.....NOTHING But giant fucking douchebags, people that think their shit doesnt stink, think they are the next best thing in the world, etc it's disgusting.  bunch of fake ass mother fuckers in the room.  the BEST ones were the people sitting in the corner or sitting at the restaurant looking on or being quiet.

Heph333,Late stage entrepreneurism. A big circlejerk. I moved over to r/smallbusiness. It's a better fit for me anyway as I'm older and have a more traditional view of what it means to produce value.

I don't begrudge those who make a success in e-commerce, but it seems like the lottery; you only have a very small chance of truly making it big. I spent 15 years in the daytrading community & see a lot of the same biases and fallacies in here. Everyone says otherwise, but the truth is that they all want easy riches.

stairapprentice,I think the issue is that if you want really high quality, in depth stuff, you have to pay for it.

Very few successful entrepreneurs are going to sit down for 3 hours and write a detailed post -- unless it benefits them in some way. 

If it's free, it's a form of marketing (for Shopify or a scam or a company).

dpgeneration,Thanks for this post! Some great content/advice in here. One thing that stood out to me was your claim **The best way to build links is to not build links**. I've been in SEO for 3 years now, and I'd say the single biggest factor for growing our traffic from 14k per month to over 90k per month over this last year can be attributed to link-building. The articles we've built (QUALITY) links to have consistently outperformed those that we haven't put as much emphasis on, on Google Search. Some of our [stats](http://imgur.com/a/bTvrj)

None,How do I build links if I am in the Bed&Breakfast industry? The only thing that comes to my mind is social media. Linking the pages from there. Would it be effective to post pictures and also add links to the website?

chadkassis,Thanks a lot for the information. Yes SEO is not hard but it is tricky especially that Google keeps on updating its algorithms. In addition to the tools that were mentioned in the post, here are a few additional ones that i use for my clients:
-seo power suite
-seositecheckup.com
-semrush.com

Hope this helps,
ck


tianan,Yeah, I don't really worry about Google changing its algorithms. The core stays the same, so as long as you're not a spammer trying to completely game it you should be fine. You may bounce around a bit, but no sweat.

nvanprooyen,This, totally. If you are consistently trying to create value for the end user and not doing spammy, stupid shit...don't even worry about what specific changes Google is making to their algorithms. Google's goal is and has always been to rank the best / most useful sites first...despite a lot of the gaming that happens in the SEO industry. And they are getting better and better at achieving this goal all the time. Do everything with this mindset and you'll be just fine. 

Also, really good post OP. 

Prozencan,This is key, the changes mostly hurt spammers though occasional updates will negatively affect non-spammers in the short run.

doogie88,This is a very basic guide. For anyone that says "It isn't hard", I'd love to see the keywords you are ranking #1 for. Probably none, or ones getting a handful of searches per month.

tianan,One of my sites http://i.imgur.com/QEsfLb6.png

CaptainKabob,Thanks for sharing! Where are you getting those charts from?

tianan,ahrefs

CSharpSauce,honestly, the best parts of your past few posts are all the tools you use.  I'd love for you to just dump a list of your favorite tools.

seothrowawayt,/r/bigseo and /r/seo do a search for "best tools" or "favorite tools" and you can spend hours there. Tons of tools for different reasons from a wider variety of SEO talent.

karmaceutical,Wait, so if 11 websites competing for the same keywords follow your guide, they will all rank in the top 10?

acornia,That's the point, it's about getting in front of the other 10 and they will all have macro points that Google will look at to determine ranking, likely causing each other to delist. Still impressed, 150comments on a subject that only commands 2% of the workload, so that means most will put 98% of effort in, explains the frenzy.

mninetynine99,Regarding "Train". Not sure if I'm wrong or maybe you haven't seen the FAQ on the updates and rule changes. Seems that vehicles DON'T have to be IN cover to get the benefit anymore, but they have to be 50% covered. They changed it so Infantry have to be IN as well as 50% covered, but non-infantry don't have to be "IN"...  I think...

mninetynine99,this might only be applicable to woods now actually, not 100% sure...

Eaglsphan,This is a good post. I think an addon to the Aggressors entry would be Space Wolves for viability. They work very well under the Outflank strategem, which mitigates their low movement and reliance on a transport.

thetrickybuddha,Sadly Space Wolves cannot legally take Aggressors so this is not viable. I would have included it otherwise. 

Eaglsphan,I stand absolutely corrected. Thank you!

I was under the impression that they could, as other space marines could as well as being listed on Battlescribe. I suppose that's what I get for not doing my research, hah!

thetrickybuddha,All good. As someone who plays Space Wolves I'm acutely aware of our limitations in unit selection. :)

Knowvember42,Why can't we (Space Wolves) take Aggressors? It's on GW's Primaris PDF that we can, and I don't see what would override that. It's also in our Chapter Approved. 

thetrickybuddha,Yep. This was brought up someone else and the guide was updated accordingly. Thanks for letting me know. :)

shocksalot123,They certainly can; check Chapter Approved page 117; Space Wolves unit listings - Aggressor Squad.

Eaglsphan,Outsanding! I had not thought to look at the unit listing itself, instead trying to find it on the 'approved units' listing in the Index having not seen a specific list update in the CA.

Thank you!

shocksalot123,You are welcome sir! Happy Gaming!

thetrickybuddha,You are right. I missed that they just added the entry. Updated the guide accordingly.

Maccai3,I think you are missing 2 things with the Aggressors.  First, they suffer no penalty for advancing and shooting their Boltstorms so they actually have 5"+D6 movement unless you're wanting to charge them.  They're abit more mobile than people think.

Secondly, the double shots when they dont move is pretty big with these boys, 3 of these (111 points) can average over 20 dead Gaunts a turn.  They're not too bad on an objective in cover with an Ancient.

That being said they are situational like you said, they're good to use an Auspex Scan with.

thetrickybuddha,Agreed on all counts. Situational but they might have some merit in the right list. I still think they are the weakest of the non-character units. But this guide was to try and see the value in them and every little bit helps.

None,You still can, I’m a pot on the stove. Chicken tortilla soup isn’t something that requires a slow cooker

ThisIsHowWeDoItBammB,It was more the symbolism of the dish. My dreams for low effort long cooking warmth and comfort were shattered. I decided to go with medium effort, fatty and regret filled. 

None,I hear you, and I’m not trying to troll you or anything like that. I was just thinking that you already went out and bought the ingredients, and you were probably craving some chicken tortilla soup after all that. So I just wanted to let you know that you had other options.

ThisIsHowWeDoItBammB,I appreciate it bud! I didn't think you were trollin. I know I could have potted it and had similar results. I just wanted to get it all off my mind. :)

Comrade_Mittens,Your user name looks familiar. Didn't you used to post all the time on imgur? I think I remember people referring to you as an "imgur celebrity" at some point -- probably around the time I left because they were saying shit like "imgur celebrity".

None,[deleted]

Comrade_Mittens,I see SlimJones123 posting everywhere, all the time, but that's the only one I've ever really noticed. I never put any thought into recognizable Reddit users, probably because it isn't being shoved in my face constantly like imgur.

Rob_1089,Honestly the only time I look at people's names on Reddit is when someone puts a "relevant username"

KuKuMacadoo,> probably around the time I left because they were saying shit like "imgur celebrity".

Lol, exactly. I still post from time to time on there but go months at a time between posts. Mainly the scenario is... someone will send me a link, I start browsing around and quickly realize why I left. Not sure about you, but I feel like Imgur used to truly be kinda cool. I started around 4 years ago and back then, the community was smaller and seemed to be rather thoughtful, funny and intelligent. Now it's essentially Facebook with a bunch of people you wouldn't hang out with irl.

Comrade_Mittens,Agreed. I liked how it was a little bit of every subreddit and their own thing, then people showed up, who wanted to label it a community and started a sort of hive mind agenda to fit it. Everything became that awkward "pengu1n of d00m" rhetoric. I realized I wasn't in their age demographic anymore a couple years ago and never looked back.
