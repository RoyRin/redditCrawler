mwbox: I'm probably going to get banned for this but one solution that would decrease response times while kids are dying would be to have first responders on site. This is the part that would get me banned- concealed carry school staff- teachers, administrators, janitors, cafeteria staff. Most teachers would not accept this responsibility but the few that would are prevented by "Gun Free Zone" policies.

While the police are on their way, kids are dying.

While the police are setting up a command post, gathering and studying maps, gathering information, formulating strategy so they don't go in blind- doing their jobs the best way that they can- kids are dying.

The people already on site, who know the layout by heart, who recognize which kids belong there and which kids don't could do this while the very best police force in the world in still on their way.


CraftyFellow_: Worked for the Israelis.

mwbox: People who know how and are willing to do what they have to to keep their children alive.

Was it Golda Maier who said something like "We will have peace when they love their own children more than they hate us"?

Black_Hipster: Don't most schools already have officers on site?

mwbox: This one did. Somehow their paths never crossed. 

mwbox: It brings me no joy to have had my biases confirmed in this case.

skootchingdog: I'm all for rapid first responders and not waiting for police.  What you describe *was* the standard protocol.  Now my cop friend tells me it's run with what you brought, take no time to wait.

mcjunker: I got to be a volunteer in an active shooter scenario to train local cops- my job was to scream and cry and run around like a chicken with its head cut off while the cops rolled through clearing the building.

Most teams breached and entered in a minute or two, went room to room until they found the "shooter". One team took ten minutes to even enter the front door. Most of the volunteers stopped screaming and were like, "Wut? Did it end? Did they go home and not tell us?"

Turns out the last time that team had trained was in like 2003. Back then it was all about caution, taking it slow, doing it right. It gave the shooter enough time to visit every room 10 times.

It was an interesting experience.

ImpGangBoss: It's crazy this isn't implemented already.

Armored cars have armed protection. Shit, lots of **shopping malls** have armed protection.

But children, who are **by far** our most important commodity, and who should be our number one priority to protect, aren't given the same level of protection a shopping mall is.

The only people obeying gun free zone laws are the people who don't intend to harm anyone.

Schools should have two armed security guards, or at the very least some teachers who are trained to conceal carry.

barbarismbeginshome: Because it is totally ridiculous. No civilised nation on earth needs teachers carrying weapons to keep schools safe. No teacher or member of staff is going to be able to capably respond in a moment like that compared to a police officer, and hiring security would be a massive burden.

AdwokatDiabel: Well while you vacillate, kids will die.  Who cares what other countries do, this is America.  You're not gonna take away our guns so figure out another way.

barbarismbeginshome: And you think the reasonable option here is employing almost 100 000 new public employees, most of whom will never do anything? America isn’t the only nation with a large gun owning population, arming more people in schools isn’t needed in those places either.

AdwokatDiabel: So what's your plan? To suggest ideas that will never work in the USA?  In the meantime while we're arguing, kids will continue to die.

barbarismbeginshome: I'm not suggesting an idea, I'm simply saying that your idea is ridiculous and untenable. There is clearly an option that does not involve gutting gun ownership, because you don't see this shite happening in Switzerland.

AdwokatDiabel: How is it ridiculous and untenable?  It's just one more cop somewhere.  

Also Switzerland?  Are you now supportive of giving Americans full auto rifles with some training? Lol

barbarismbeginshome: Because it’s 100 000 extra cops who likely won’t ever have to do anything. I’m not saying give everyone automatic weapons, I’m saying that their isn’t anything about gun ownership that means you have to arm schools.

SaddestClown: > Schools should have two armed security guards, or at the very least some teachers who are trained to conceal carry.

I'm fine with that BUT folks aren't going to pay for it.  We already have school districts going to 4 days a week because they're spending so little on schools and they aren't going to pay security guards and give raises to teachers taking on carry responsibility. 

mtskin: who will pay for it?  i agree we need a solution and having armed guards in schools would be a great deterrent but i’m over taxed as it is. 

SillySandoon: I know there are many teachers who, if allowed to, would gladly pay for their own training and carry their own gun. It likely wouldn’t get guns in every school, but it also wouldn’t cost the state a dime. 

darthcoder: Teacehers should be allowed to carry.

usefulthings: I'd trade an assistant principal for an armed guard.

thebaldfox: We could, maybe, use some of that 70 billion that was just added to our already ludicrous military budget to pay for it? Just a thought.

itsnotevenheavy: This government would never take money from the the military industrial complex to invest in schools and education. 

Not their style. 

Going to have to wait a few years. 

wakkawakka18: Weren't there two armed police officers at the Florida school that did fuck all?

Teh_Compass: Police don't have a duty to protect you.

Some rando with a license to carry doesn't either, but they will protect themselves. Some may even protect those close to them, either because they adopt the "sheepdog mentality" (not really my thing but you do you, guy) or because they care about those close to them (family, students, etc).

wakkawakka18: Their motto is literally to protect and serve. They do have a duty to protect people. Whether they chose to or not is a whole other matter. 

Teh_Compass: >Their motto is literally to protect and serve

That was LAPD's motto and it was adopted by other agencies. Not all PDs use that motto.

>They do have a duty to protect people

[No, they don't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia)

wakkawakka18: Holy shit your right I didn't know that. I guess that's one more reason to hate the police, even though I didn't need another

TehMephs: That’s because to take this approach would require antis to submit that guns are useful for self defense, and it’s more important they just get their way - if they actually cared about the kids beyond using them to further their agenda of confiscation you’d see more posts with that kind of energy rallying for cures to the diseases killing orders of magnitude more kids than guns are, or putting drunk driving down once and for all, or a slew of things more deadly to kids these days than a murderous asshole with a gun.  

Thing is it really is easier to arm a few of the staff or teachers or train them than scream and kick until everyone just complies and hands over their property, and there’s no evidence suggesting armed teachers would be worse than unarmed in any way

Guns are bad so we can’t accept the idea of a gun in a teacher’s possession around *children*

StaplerLivesMatter: > While the police are setting up a command post, gathering and studying maps, gathering information, formulating strategy so they don't go in blind- doing their jobs the best way that they can- kids are dying.

That's not entirely accurate. The standard procedure now is for the first officer to, at most, wait for the next two or three responding officers before making entry and attempting to locate the shooter. They learned their lesson at Columbine, where the shooters were calmly executing people in the library while the police dug in and anticipated a hostage standoff. 

But otherwise I agree. Best defense is a good offense. One person of mediocre shooting ability 30 seconds away beats a SWAT team 20 minutes away. If you don't want teachers carrying on their person, have a locker in the administrative office with a pair of ARs and a few people on the staff who have completed a carbine course. "But we shouldn't have to live in a society where we need guns in schools!"? Too bad, we do. The Israelis do, they gotta deal with teenagers wearing suicide vests. We can bellyache about fixing a society of 325 million people, or we can take concrete actionable steps to keep children safe. 

When you are a school administrator, those kids are under your personal protection while they are in your building. You should be prepared to defend them from squad of Al Qaeda paratroopers if it comes to that. 

PinkoBastard: Yeah, I think that'd be the best way to do it. Honestly, I've never liked the idea of guns in schools, but you actually have changed my mind. It is better to have access to defense than to keep people like me from feeling a bit uncomfortable about having weapons in a school. 

AdwokatDiabel: Seriously this.  They don't even need to be cops, but volunteers from the community too.

ROTLA: Something about this doesn't sit well with me. 

I don't think guns or politics or anger are the root problem. But it's too much to suggest that disenfranchisement among young white males is the cause either. 

The alt-right narrative is that white males are being marginalized as other as other groups are 'taking over'. But,  of course,  this is bullshit. But, that false feeling of marginalization is fueled by racist rhetoric and politics AND the belief that these white males can obtain power by violence. 

Unfortunately, this violence has the backing of the NRA and guns are tangled up in this toxic narrative. 



c_forrester_thorne: Young white males aren’t disenfranchised, but you miss what’s going on if you great young while males as a monolithic block.

There’s a segment of them that *feel* marginalized, because of a narrative pushes by extremists to recruit them. They’re told that growing equality in society is marginalization for them and advances in social justice are an anti-white program.

It works because of the toxic masculinity of our power structures. Every boy is told that there’s a standard: you will have wealth and expensive goods and you will have a beautiful woman with idealized proportions who cries out in ecstasy merely from pleasuring you. If you fail to live up to this standard you are low and bad and you will be *cucked*, which is to say all this will be taken from you by the boogeyman that popular entertainment and porn have taught you to fear: black men.

In this environment they come out with the idea that the deck is stacked against them, because video games and school grading systems have taught them that there is a direct correlation between effort and result and lack of result is evidence of lack of worth.

Then someone comes along and hooks them with a simple proposition such as “these SJWs want to ruin your entertainment” and hooks them in. From there they offer structures of personal power (the red pill) and group power (we can meme the vote) and *worth*.

These kids are waiting for someone to come along and show them *why* the deck is stacked and how to fix it, and the Internet is full of reactionaries ready to give them that, plus a healthy dose of self worth: “it’s not you that’s the problem, it’s the world!”

It doesn’t help that leftism is a harder sell: it requires that you have the maturity to examine yourself and the integrity to possibly give things up to improve the world for everyone, not just yourself. Emotions such as fear and hate at easy to encourage and manipulate than compassion and empathy.

Humans are wired for an in group and the alt-right offers one to these kids.

The Florida shooter wasn’t targeting a group. He was targeting all groups that weren’t his. We don’t know yet what prompted him, but I can guarantee you he’s not insane. He knew right from wrong and he knew what he was doing, and he felt driven to it for reasons we may not agree with, but we need to understand, so we can do something about them.

To brush him off as “he’s ‘mentally ill’, and therefore broken for no reason and we can ignore his motives and make a spectacle of his punishment” is both facile and typically American. We always look for a way to boil things down to one sentence hashtaggable solution that allows us to skip out on real thought and self examination. Pick your poison: “he’s just crazy” (Republican) or “if he hadn’t had a gun he could have lived his life of quite despair without hurting someone, so I could ignore it” (Democrat)

That’s only him, of course. We also need to be talking about how there is an anti-government group in Florida that is recruiting, arming, and radicalizing children and it is on the radar of law enforcement and no one is doing anything about it.

ROTLA: Yes. Thank you for your reply. 

Dropknees: Dude this reply deserves gold. Well said friendo.

Nomorepost: I disagree. 

The popular articles, videos, new stories, social science studies has been completely focused on women and minorities or immigrants.

When you have so many different sources completely disregarding any kind of explanation for the differences, the viewers automatically assume "racism" and "sexism".

These two conclusions have been in the narrative for years now, and it isn't necessary to make the conclusion on air anymore. It is an easy "boogeyman" that the author, news anchor, etc. can setup to show they are the "good guys" exposing the evil and showing that they are against it.

The problem is that the reasons are much more complex, and the majority or the viewers or readers, don't want to ask the hard questions or dive deeper.

White males aren't saying that they have the same struggles and tribulations that others do, but to completely neglect and alienate them as if they never have anything to worry about is the issue.

It's the constant, repetitive, relentless talking point about a women or a minority having a rough life that reinforces the audience bias that white males are the reason.

For every one article, blog, news report you have about a white male who is the victim or disadvantaged, you would have to go through thousands of other reports.


c_forrester_thorne: I’m not talking about neglecting them. Social justice and economic equality benefits everyone equally. 

Fnhatic: >I’m not talking about neglecting them. Social justice and economic equality benefits everyone equally.

Really? That certainly hasn't been the message recently.

I can **easily** make a case that white women are more privileged than white men. But upon making that case, I would immediately be called a sexist woman-hating red-piller misogynist. 

Women have issues exclusive to their group. Women have 'women's marches' and Democrats and feminists going to bat for them.

Black people have issues exclusive to their group. Black people have 'black lives matter' and Democrats and the NAACP going to bat for them.

White men have issues exclusive to their group. Who is going to bat for them? Not even Republicans are. Any groups that fight for them either are or eventually get called 'white supremacists'. 

*Every group* has issues of their own. But for some reason, "social justice", progressives, etc. all have the goal of elevating every group *except white men* to a position where all their issues are fixed. When white men complain about their issues, they get told to shut up, that they are too privileged already, and that they're racist sexist homophobic Nazis.

Look at the Black Panther movie. The cast is 80% black, but it's called 'diverse'. 'Diversity' is practically synonymous with  "no whites" these days - do you disagree? 

Look at the game that just released Kingdom Come: Deliverance. It's set in 1402 in central Europe, and so it has no black people, because there were basically none to speak of in the region. The creator was called a racist white supremacist.

Look at Manveer Heir, developer for Mass Effect: Andromeda. The guy went on massive Trumpian anti-white Twitter rants during development of the game. The SJWs never cared or raised a stink. People complained to Bioware but they never fired him or did anything.

Look at all the headlines being shat out by Vox and Salon that start with "Dear white people..."

Look at the protest at Cal Berkeley where non-white students formed a human wall and told white students they weren't allowed to go to class. The last time a bunch of racists organized to stop one race from going to school, it was called *Brown vs. Board of Education*. Every single student in that protest should've been thrown out of the school the next day. It was a disgusting display of flagrant racism and the far left celebrated it as 'bravery'.

You have a really funny way of measuring equality if you think that's what this is.

c_forrester_thorne: Women, Black people, etc. have groups going to bat for them. White males also have a group going to bat for them: It's called *society*. 

The institutions that hold all the the power are white and male. There doesn't need to be a NAAWP because we already have one, it's called the government.

None of the groups you mentioned have the kind of institutional power that white men have. White men still occupy most of the traditional places of power, and if a woman or a Black man tries to enter those spaces they are *sharply criticized*.

If a man:

* Was married to a powerful politician
* Ran for and was elected to the Senate
* Served as the United States Secretary of State
* Graduated from Yale Law
* Worked on the Nixon impeachment inquiry staff
* Taught criminal law
* Served as a state campaign organizer
* Was appointed to the board of the Legal Services Corporation by a President
* Did pro-bono legal work for children
* Was appointed to a health services agency for rural children

... and decided to cap off that career with a run for President, we'd call it a highly qualified elder statesman reaching for the capstone of a long career in public service.

If a woman with all those qualifications does the same thing, she's a grasping harpy and eats children for Satan in a pizza shop basement.

As to *Black Panther*, if somebody makes a movie with five white superheroes (and a robot...) and one black guy, *that* is called diverse, so why not a movie about Black superpeople set in Africa with two white guys? Aren't you doing the same thing as the people attacking the Polish role playing game?

Also: The people who call the Polish video game about Polish white people racist, the people calling Black Panther "diverse" (I still don't get why exactly that's a problem or offensive) and the people organizing women's marches do not sit on the Black People and Women's People Unified Committees who Represent All Black And/Or Female People. We live in an age where anyone can claim to speak to any group, and in all the noise generated by social media and decentralized social movements there are a lot of people who grab the soapbox out of a desire to troll or stir people up or act as propaganda shills for the opposing view or just be weird, and their presence is more magnified by social media than ever before. The Society for Cutting Up Men was around in the 1970's and it was a joke then too.

There is no coordinated movement to oppress white men. When everyone is rising to your level, it's easy, from your perspective, to think that you're sinking. That trick of perspective is an reactionary recruiting tool. The alt-right and similar groups don't want to empower white men, they support the dehumanizing toxicity of patriarchal, capitalist power structures and the masculinity culture of perpetual competition, predation, and acquisition that empowers *rich* white men.

The white men's movement *is* the black people's movement and the women's movement, because the power structures that oppress white men and make mass shooters and sad people who live tortured lives oppress everyone and use racial, gender, age, etc divisions to keep the great bulk of people who have the numbers but not the wealth and power from noticing that the people who have the wealth and power but not the numbers are fucking us over based on arbitrary rules they made up to make sure they win the game.

Nomorepost: I just want to add I don't think anyone should claim to know the psych behind this shooter or the others unless they are a qualified psychologist, and knew or researched the individual extensively.

That being said, I think your assessment of white men only "feeling" disenfranchised is wrong because you don't think they are being neglected.

There's a difference from people striving to become equal, and people striving to bring others down in order to achieve equality.

There are people who are trying swing the pendulum, instead of securing it in its place in the middle.

c_forrester_thorne: The idea that there are people trying to put white people down is a myth. In the age of leaderless /#hashtag movements, anyone can proclaim themselves BLM or Antifa or whatever. It’s easy for shills to make a BLM account and scream Kill Whitey and use that in their own propaganda aimed at the other side. The Russians do this but they’re not the *only* ones doing it by far.

Nomorepost: In your own world it is a myth. But just because you are ignorant doesn't discredit what I see and experience in my own life. I see it with my own eyes on YouTube, I see news stories that either no one talks about or never hits the mainstream media, I have been called a neo nazi just because I don't support illegal immigration and I'm white.

If you want to burry your head and pretend any story that shows what you don't already believe is a "shill" or "Russia", then please remember, instead of trying to verify and further research for yourself, you are choosing to be ignorant, not the other way around.



yeahoner: i think you are missing or sidestepping the point. Nobody here is saying the problem is disenfranchisement of white males.  The issue is he disconnect from our fellows, and demonizing/ dehumanizing  the "other team" by both sides until killing people doesn't seem like killing people, but seems like a rational reaction to a feeling of powerlessness.

ROTLA: Pardon, my response was for another comment. 

But,  let's be clear, there is one political party who uses violence, racism, guns and religion as part of their overall strategy. I'm not saying there isn't demonizing among liberals but we cannot let R's off the hook for what they've done.  

Narian: > demonizing/ dehumanizing the "other team" by both sides until killing people doesn't seem like killing people

Then can we focus on the primary cause of this shit? Because if you say both sides are to blame I'm gonna have an aneurysm I can't take this level of purposeful ignorance. 

Have you seen the NRA ads (the same group funded by Russia!)? They're fucking insane! "They" "They" "They" - codewords for cowards - who's They? Anyone you want, that's the beauty of it. Don't like blacks? Jews? Liberals? That's "They"!

But yeah, it's both sides. Obama is a Kenyan Muslim. Obama is the antichrist. He's gonna take your guns. He's gonna run for office a third time. 

NONE OF IT HAPPENS. The right wing narratives NEVER. FUCKING. HAPPENS. FEMA death camps? What about those? What about when Obama was using the military to get ready to start a coup? 

What about MICHELLE OBAMA IS A MAN? What's the both sides equivalent for the left? 

But after all that - the important thing is that they need help! And every time we try to help we get attacked! And then you come in a declare 'both sides' in an attempt to minimize RESPONSIBILITY for the right-wing who push what? Love, peace, equality? Nope: hate, fear and lies. 

But yeah, both sides. Really well-thought out opinion. 

verylittlefinger: https://mobile.twitter.com/gavinnewsom/status/941359276823535616

That’s obviously a totally accurate representation of gun owners. /s

If you want to see left wing narratives which as as bonkers as the above right wing narratives, come live in Seattle. Examine the speeches of Kshama Sawant, a councilwoman here who calls to nationalize Boeing, Microsoft and Amazon. Or Nikkita (sic) Oliver who almost became a mayor here (3rd most popular candidate in the primary). Or Jon Grant who, upon learning that all gun stores closed in Seattle after they instituted gun tax which made it impossible to run a business here, called for tripling it to compensate for lost revenues.

My friend, left wing has as many idiots as the right wing, and they are equally stupid.

AlexWIWA: Wanting to nationalize a company that usually works for the military is as bad as calling to murder liberals, got it. 

JustMeAgainMarge: I think you missed the point the OP made about divisiveness and demonization of other groups....

yeahoner: Where did I say both sides are the same? Nowhere.  Demonizing and dehumanizing people with an opposing view is a problem both sides have.  It’s ‘toxic tribalism’.  The republicans may very well be more evil than the democrats, but that doesn’t negate the need fix the problems with the Democratic Party.   Their evil doesn’t justify ours.  That there is the path to the dark side. 

bobthetitanic: Both sides are bad in different ways.

EchoRadius: Uhg.. I'm exhausted with everyone trying to name what it the problem is, or ways to correct it, while completely glossing over the real issue...

Humans are irrational, messy, unpredictable creatures that shouldn't have access to weapons that are strictly designed to indiscriminately kill a group of people in a matter of seconds.

Trying to point the finger towards any other reasoning is simply avoiding overall truth stated above.

I'm sure there's all kinds of 'responsible gun owners' in here... But that's today. What about tomorrow? Next month? 5 years from now? Catch your wife gettin banged by your best friend, lose your job, and suddenly your kids hate you? These things happen. I don't trust people that I've known my whole life to be perfectly rational in any/all situation. People snap. That's it. It happens to thousands of people a day, we let em all have practically unlimited access to ridiculously powerful weapons that fire in fractions of a second and we're all "maybe it's games? Maybe more health services? Maybe we need to go to church more? Maybe kids just need a good spanking more often?". All of these things are attempts to avoid the truth... Humans can't be trusted with this kind of power.

If you have that little control over your emotions you should really talk to somebody about anger management. It's not a failing to admit you need help.

TehMephs: This idea that people have zero control over their reactions or judgement is misguided.  Do you realize how many people own guns?  Now consider how often out of all those people, tons of them are pushed to extremes of anger, depression, despair, even desperation yet never even think a gun is an appropriate solution to said problem?  You’ll find your misconceptions really say more about you than the people holding the hundreds of millions of firearms on a daily basis in this country without murdering each other or even threatening to.  It sounds like you are the type of person who should never consider owning a firearm because you sound unstable and like you’re projecting some serious dysfunction imho

I’ve been pushed to extremes many times in my life and reaching for a gun never crossed my mind as a viable option.  They are strictly for a life or death situation where there is no other option but lethal force to prevent loss of my life or someone I love.  That is the *only* time I and pretty much most gun owners would ever reach for them in a context that involves harming another person.  Outside that, they’re a hobby and I wouldn’t mind getting into competition shooting soon, and as an absolute worst case defensive tool which I would hope to the Flying Spaghetti Monster I never, ever have to use on another living creature - human or otherwise.

These murders are really fringe cases when you examine the statistics under a microscope and filter out the fear mongering and fluff

Damn hopefuls, can't they learn to keep quiet and stay nice and understand that a massive group of american men are dead set on defending their hobby at the cost of countless American lives?

Let me be the second to say that guns and gun culture have NOTHING to do with the massive amount of firearm-related tragedy and that it is ***actually*** the fault of those who get emotional when attempting to argue against our wonderful hobby that is great and never bad except for those gosh darn conservative gun owners who say mean things back and somehow put us righteous gun owners in a bad light!!!

Acheros: > gun-related abuse, violence and murders


Why do only *gun related* violence and murders matter? do you believe that a gun somehow kills you any more dead than a knife? or a baseball bat to the cranium?

"Oh, he's only MOSTLY dead, thank god he wasn't shot!"

I guarantee you no one who was stabbed to death was sitting there in a pool of their own blood going "Well, at least I wasn't shot to death. this is much better."


The facts show that gun laws do nothing to curb violent crime or murder rates. the only thing it changes is what weapons are used by criminals.

poverty and mental illness are much, much better indicators for violent crime. as poverty levels go down, and mental healthcare goes up, ALL violent crimes go down.

Servicemaster: All injustices matter. This one is obviously heavily gun related and I refuse to argue with anyone who cannot see that and wants to deflect away from their toxic firearm culture.

Acheros: > All injustices matter. 

Then why do you only care about firearms related crime?

>. This one is obviously heavily gun related

No. It's not a tragedy because 17 people were shot to death and twice that are wounded by guns.

it's a tragedy because 17 people are dead, and twice that were wounded at all.

Gun laws don't change murder rates. if you care about people you won't go after the symptoms. you'll go after the disease. the fact of the matter is AMERICAN CULTURE is sick and clearly promotes violence on some level or another. If you want to actually promote a positive change instead of a lateral change, supporting healthcare reform and poverty reduction is the way to do that.

> I refuse to argue with anyone who cannot see that and wants to deflect away from their toxic firearm culture.

I REFUSE TO ARGUE WITH ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH ME. WAAAAAAAHHHHH!


You don't like guns. you don't like people who have guns. At BEST you're narrow sighted, and worst you're a disingenuous asshole who's using caskets as a soap box just because you don't *like* that someone else has firearms when you choose not too. But the fact of the matter is that gun laws have absolutely zero effect on what actually matters; the rates of violent crimes. The only impact they have is what items are used *in* those violent crimes.

Servicemaster: Go fuck yourself.

Acheros: Yeah, that's what I thought, just like every other retard when you can't argue. choke on a dick.

Servicemaster: Go through my history, I've already said my peace. My piece. I have many pieces about firearm fans and you're all the same.

You're men. You never see a woman mass shoot anything but they suffer from mental illness too. So let's stop shaming the crazy and start shaming the people who literally bitch and moan about their hobby being regulated after our neighbor's children grow up with these tragedies regularly.

It's like y'all got addicted to 9/11. Gotta go to war after a tragedy. Every time. Except we're killing ourselves this time. Civil War 2.

Acheros: > Go through my history,

Yup. I was right.

You're a disgusting, hateful individual who preaches from a pile of dead bodies.

You don't care about anyones health. you don't care about anyones safety.

You hate guns. you hate people who own guns. so you use the tragedies and deaths of innocent people to push your fucking agenda. 

You don't care about any one of these kids. I bet you don't know a single one of their names. Their nothing but props for you to use.

Servicemaster: That doesn't make any sense on a fundamental level. I'm literally arguing against any situation where this exact tragedy could happen again by saying the 2nd Amendment is terrible and you want to try and tell me I'm against the victims?

That's like screaming at a defense attorney that they hate their client. Most of whom are incredibly underpaid. This shit gets deep but you don't care. You just *have* to defend your toy instead of those defenseless children.

Acheros: > That doesn't make any sense on a fundamental level

No. You're just too up your own ass.

>you want to try and tell me I'm against the victims?

No. you're not "against them". You're using them. You hate gun owners, you hate guns. and you don't *care* about them. You're using them to prop up your agenda. nothing more.

Servicemaster: But why would I have that agenda in the first place? I play a lot of games where guns are fun as fuck to mess around with. I get it, really I do.

Guns aren't worth these deaths. Too many folk like you think it's okay and it's just how it'll have to be because this just does NOT happen in other countries. We're killing our tourism. We're killing our kids. And all you people can think about is how wrong the people who hate on your tool of death can be after yet ANOTHER massive tragedy.

Acheros: > But why would I have that agenda in the first place?

No idea. Why does anyone hate anything? My guess, you're a useful idiot who bought into the propaganda.

> I play a lot of games where guns are fun as fuck to mess around with.

Oh, well EXCUSE ME mister firearms expert. I didn't realize you were one of the pawn stars expert witnesses.

>I get it, really I do.


No. You don't. The fact that you call guns a "hobby" and "toys", and compare call of duty to people who have actual firearms experience and training proves that you know nothing. You're a champagne liberal.

>all you people can think about is

Do not put words in my mouth.

I actually care about these kids. unlike you. You know how you can tell this? because while you're pushing a fucking agenda based on hatred, and fear. I'm worried about things that have actually been a PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF COMBATING VIOLENT CRIME RATES. Poverty and mental healthcare.

You want to know why other countries have lower "gun crimes"? because they have LESS CRIMES. PERIOD. Do you know why this is? because they have a better infrastructure for the well being of their citizens. Is any country perfect in that regard? absolutely not. But things like universal healthcare, proper mental healthcare, better treatment of the poor. Those things actually fucking help.

Servicemaster: > No idea. Why does anyone hate anything?

I literally told you, I hate firearms because they allow atrocities to take place like school shootings and mass shootings and gun abuse and gun violence and those seem to be far more prevalent than the good guns do which I'm still looking for but all I can find is National Authority and Imperialism.

You acktually care about those kids and then blame the poor and sick instead of the tool used to carry out such tragedies. You don't understand cause and effect and need to stop but you won't and neither will the thousands of other male americans who love their hobby more than safety.

Acheros: You're so up your own ass you literally can't go a single post without being an insulting douche bag. This is the face of gun control.

> instead of the tool used

You mean, its the person DOING IT WHOS TO BLAME INSTEAD OF THE ITEM THEY USED!??!!?!?

WELL JESUS FUCKING CHRIST SHERLOCK YOU CRACKED THE GOD DAMN GOD.

aaaaand thank you for proving my point you dumbass.

Servicemaster: I bought my gun years ago, still waiting to use it to get more freedom but it just sits in my closet like a forgotten hobby.

Acheros: ahahahaha. and now you're pretending to be a gun owner. cute.

Servicemaster: thatsthejoke.jpg you talking toolbox.

Acheros: Awww, still with the insults. Guess you're just too stupid to argue anything without being a condescending, insulting douche canoe. This is why gun haters will never win.

You don't want facts. You don't care about people. You're a hatred spewing worthless cunt.

Access to firearms is a civil right, not a hobby. And if we're going to talk about rescinding civil rights in the name of safety we should go after the 4th Amendment first, imagine how many lives would be saved if the cops could just search a person's home and lock them up just for suspicion!

Servicemaster: They're called AMENDments because we can change them if they create a toxic culture of death or inhibit freedom. Which is why the 13th Amendment should be amended first since it literally allows slavery in the present day.

And because we can VOTE to change that, we dont have to threaten our dear leaders with guns in order to liberate those unfairly imprisoned by the authoritative state.

So yeah, fuck the 2nd and the 13th amendment unless all you hypocriticaliberal gun lovers suddenly take the streets armed demanding freedom for your fellow countryfolk. Use the 2nd to destroy the 13th.

I refuse to wait on yall so until then I'm going to keep calling out your bullshit culture of death machines.

RunShootDrink: They're called amendments because they amended the original document. Yes, they can be changed, but they are a part of the constitution the same as the original three articles.

Gawwad: Pretty much of these school shootings are carried out with legally purchased guns. How many do you think an attacker could get with a kitchen knife? Is owning guns for fun more important than stopping mass shootings?

Archleon: They ain't just for fun. 

/r/dgu

Gawwad: I like how the top post there is about a case where 26 people died thanks to legally owned guns.

Archleon: I like how you straight up ignore information you don't like. That whole "shall not be infringed" thing is so inconvenient, eh?

Gawwad: What I don't like is you people valuing your bad boy toys more than the lifes of people who die because of them.

Archleon: Anywhere from 500,000 to 3 million defensive gun uses per year, and a civil liberty protected explicitly by the Constitution, with language that appears nowhere else in the document. Yeah, I consider that really important. Punishing millions and millions of law abiding gun owners, stripping them of a right without due process is also unconstitutional. Typically, I'm not a "love it or leave it" kind of guy, because I think as a people we should work toward a common ground. However, if you disagree with principles set forth in our Bill of Rights, ideals that this country was founded upon, then perhaps this isn't the place for you.

Gawwad: Definitely isn't. I just like to make fun of the stupidity of the bad half of americans. Luckily I don't live in a shithole where people regularly get shot by people who bought an assault rifle from a grocery store :)

Archleon: There aren't any places where anyone lives like that, except in your head. 

Gawwad: This happens weekly in USA. Mostly semi auto guns, though you can't achieve much more with full auto.

Archleon: .003 percent of gun casualties come from a mass shooting of any kind. Swimming pools, alcohol, stairs, horses, and beds kill more people every year. 

No one is terrified of getting shot at the grocery store unless they're dimwitted (which, to be fair, you may be), because they're a statistical anomaly akin to being twice-struck by lightning. 

Gawwad: Having more mass shootings than war zones is fine because it's not the leading cause of death. 👌👌👌👌👌

Archleon: I see your acquaintance with reality could barely be called "passing." Guess we better get the ball rolling on stricter horse and stair regulations.

Gawwad: Horses and chairs are useful. Guns are not. The only use of a gun is to kill or destroy. Civilians should not have them. Especially when they are demonstratably stupid as fuck (see this sub for example).

Archleon: I've already linked you a pretty good start to reading about defensive gun use, which again, happens 500,000 to 3 million times a year. Ignoring that doesn't actually make it go away. Why are you okay standing on the dead bodies of children to make a point about guns, but not about anything else? Even when those things are far more deadly? 

However, it is your right to be myopic and uninformed. If you truly believe civilians should not own guns (having clearly not thought through the implications of condoning force done on your behalf, just not by you, and the lack of character necessary to reach that conclusion), then lucky for you there exists a way for you to make that a reality, at least on paper. You are wholly within your right to advocate for amending the Constitution, and I wish you luck in that endeavor. 

Gawwad: Those other things have actual uses. Cars get people to places, chair you can sit on. Guns are only good for destruction and need to be controlled. No civilian needs to have a gun at home.

Archleon: You're still ignoring about 80% of what I said. Allow me to repeat the most salient, though by no means the only, point you're ignoring:

>However, it is your right to be myopic and uninformed. If you truly believe civilians should not own guns (having clearly not thought through the implications of condoning force done on your behalf, just not by you, and the lack of character necessary to reach that conclusion), then **lucky for you there exists a way for you to make that a reality, at least on paper. You are wholly within your right to advocate for amending the Constitution, and I wish you luck in that endeavor.**

I added emphasis, since you seem to have some trouble parsing simple English. 



Gawwad: I don't live in your shithole ans ignored your irrelevant ramblings. I'm only pointing out the stupidity of you people here.

Archleon: So you have no idea what you're talking about then, and will ignore real world data to support your predetermined conclusions. I see. 

Gawwad: Better idea than you, obviously. No other country has this problem. The difference between USA and other FW countries is the lack of gun control. You gun nuts value your toys over the lives of people even when people are constantly dying. 

Archleon: You've become a broken record, and repeating yourself doesn't actually make reality conform to your statements. Should you actually wish to become educated on the subject, I'll leave this here. Beyond that, I can't help you, and unfortunately for you, the extent of your efficacy consists of bitching on the internet. Have a good day.

None: Marx did not believe in private property so how can you say that he was pro second amendment which dictates that the state can not interfere with an **individual's** right to bear arms. 

Plenty of neocons and neoliberals would love this quote because they could twist it into their narrative of the army or national guard meeting our founders vision for the second amendment.

longhorn617: Incorrect. Marx believed in the social ownership of private property, which are things like machines or land (means of production), which are owned by capitalists who then passively profit from the work done my workers to generate goods and services. Guns are personal property, which Marx believed should not be individually owned as long as they were gained in a fair manner.


None: I am guessing the fact that every communist nation ever did not allow it's citizens to own firearms is just another example of "real communism has never been tried before".

Even if Marx did approve of individuals owning guns then this would be just a railroading of our original conversation when I stated: "gun ownership is more of a classical liberal position than what passes for liberalism these days so the title spooks me." The modern left, at least in it's leadership is not marxist but rather corporatist and neoliberal. Can you truly refute my original statement about modern liberal politics being anti-gun without dredging up a quote from 200 years ago by a dead man?



longhorn617: >I am guessing the fact that every communist nation ever did not allow it's citizens to own firearms is just another example of "real communism has never been tried before".

That has more to do with authoritarianism than communism. The types of communist that would be against that sort of stuff also believe in abolishing the state. The Nazis (and other far-right/fascist regimes) banned guns and they were not leftist (they locked up and exterminated communists, so don't even try and start with that "the Nazis were leftists" bullshit)

Racism passes as a value of the right in modern politics. Is it that conservative ideology is racist, or that racists happen to be more likely to be conservative?

This country was founded by the leftist radicals of their day, and they were pro-gun. About 20% of Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters own guns, compared to about 44% of Republicans or Republican-leaning voters. While it may be true that Democrats do not own find at the same rate as Republicans, or support the same legislation on average, gun ownership is an issue of authoritarianism and not the left-vs-right political spectrum, hence why this sub exists. There is a significant difference between the opinions of NRA and non-NRA gun owners.

Leftist infighting is a son of a bitch.

If you let the left define the right then yes. I see more racism or at least racialism on the left than in the mainstream right aka conservatism.

>This country was founded by the leftist radicals of their day, and they were pro-gun.

I completely agree. I view myself as being more aligned with their views than the modern right or left is.

>gun ownership is an issue of authoritarianism and not the left-vs-right political spectrum

I *mostly* agree but we can not ignore the fact that the left is incredibly authoritarian.. leftists set racial quotas, diversity quotas, gun regulations and etc.. They can not leave anything to the common people to decide or just play out.

>There is a significant difference between the opinions of NRA and non-NRA gun owners.

You can buy and even sell that narrative all you want but fact remains that there is no other pro gun significant voice in America than the NRA. If you tear them down then all that will essentially be left would be the gun grabbing bloomberg groups.

Do you think that the soviet union of the 40's supposedly being against racism means that the America left of 2017 must not be either? Do you really think that is an argument?

>Race! It is a feeling, not a reality: ninety-five percent, at least, is a feeling. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today. Amusingly enough, not one of those who have proclaimed the "nobility" of the Teutonic race was himself a Teuton.

[ORLY?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnIVVWtAag)

slayer_of_idiots: So you're mad because the NRA opposes antifa?

mutatron: No.

walofuzz: Yes.

Seeing as ANTIFA is not an organization and literally just means “people who are against fascism”.

The media conflates ANTIFA with Black Bloc anarchist protesters, and that isn’t the same thing at all. 

I am ANTIFA. I am against Fascism. I do not destroy property or participate in riots. 

This is a fucking conflation that’s equating anti-authoritarians with domestic terrorists. Some anti fascists are violent. Vast majority are not. Vast majority of Americans are ANTIFA but don’t identify as such because the media has conflated that term with violent protesters. 

slayer_of_idiots: Antifa is absolutely an organization.  The people you see rioting and burning shit, they call themselves antifa.  The things they're doing and protesting have very little to do with opposing actual fascism.

Identifying as anti-fascist is meaningless.  It's like saying you're anti-slavery.  There are no pro-slavery or pro-fascist movements.

walofuzz: Yes, there certainly are. Did you not hear about Charlottesville? What do you think white nationalists are, exactly?

ANTIFA is not an organization. There is no structure. There is no leadership. There is no *organization*. Just like Anonymous is not an organization, and just like BLM is not an organization. It is an ideological movement. 

ANTIFA literally just means anti-fascist, and there happen to be anarchists who are *also* anti-fascists. It’s intersectional identity. Those are the people the media shows because showing them on TV stirs up the most shit. 

If the news just labeled the rest of our tubby neckbearded asses “ANTIFA” instead of the small minority who dress in black and destroy property, nobody would give a shit and it wouldn’t get any views. 

slayer_of_idiots: Whitey supremacists are racists.  They don't really have anything to do with fascism.  The few thousand actual white supremacist Nazis in the US don't constitute an actual movement.  No one takes them seriously and they have zero political power.  Forming a movement to oppose them isn't going to achieve anything.  It's like forming a giant movement to oppose flat Earthers.

Just because antifa and BLM doesn't have any national organization doesn't mean there aren't any organizations.  They each have websites, with local chapters you can join, with lists of events.  That's a fucking organization.  Just because they don't elect officers and leaders doesn't change anything.

> ANTIFA literally just means anti-fascist

And the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea ostensibly means a Democratic Republic, but we all know it doesn't represent any of those things.  

You can claim antifa means anything you want, but I'm going to judge them based off what they're actually doing, which is opposing free speech for conservatives, protesting anything related to Trump, and rioting and destroying public and private property.

It's not a small minority.  Look at any antifa protest and they're filled with people like this with masks and sticks.

walofuzz: Man you’re just plain incorrect. I don’t have enough time in my day to refute that wall of complete bullshit.

Comrade_Belinski: Pretty funny they use "repeat their narrative" when thats exactly what they are doing. Double standard at it's finest. 

SomeDEGuy: The NRA has veered into arguments and messages that have more to do with conservative politics instead of just gun rights. Now, their strategists may have guided them to that because they think republicans are their best bet and have given up on the democratic party, but it does alienate the allies they may have had on the left.

Spooky2000: Ah,  yes,  because we all know the only way to kill people is with guns and that killing is the only thing people do with them...

target_meet_arrow: Which is a half truth. They were founded in 1871 but they didn't start lobbying and fighting for civil rights until the 30s. 

The National Association for the Deaf is probably the oldest civil rights organization.

dexdin: Apart from some of the ridiculous things the NRA does. Whats wrong with them?

The vast majority of the organization (manpower and money) goes to teaching people about gun safety etc..

lornstar7: Aside from the terrible things serial killers do, alot of their time is spent just going to work and church 

bluetincan: IDK reddit seems to love Bill Gates.

lornstar7: But doesn't care for Ted Cruz 

Comrade_Belinski: The fuck does bill gates have to do with anything.

dexdin: How is that related to the NRA

what is wrong with work and church? really this is fascinating to me. 

mr_perry_walker: I think the point is that just 'cause they do a pile good, healthy, normal things does not excuse the ungood, unhealthy, vile things they do. 

dexdin: Firstly, ungood seems odd, try using terrible next time it fits better

secondly, than why not reform it. Make something better? and if you cant point out the good things, than whats the point of just pointing out the bad. Get good ideas from everywhere you can

also. Ive asked twice already. But what are the "bad" things everyone keeps referring to like it a kevin spacey secret

mr_perry_walker: Nah, I like ungood (and before offering style advice you might want to have a more solid grasp on the language first, "like it a kevin spacey secret", come on man). 

Anyway, I wasn't the person you initially responded to, I was just trying to clarify their metaphor. As for what's wrong with the NRA? I don't really know, I don't keep up on it, but you aren't wrong, dwelling on the bad is seldom productive and fixing whatever is wrong with it sounds like a great idea. 

dexdin: I havent slept in a long time, something like 48 hours and its currently 7am and I need to be up in a hour for work

Also I am terrible with grammar, as 1. im terrible and 2. I dont care about my grammar on Reddit. As long as you can mostly understand what I am trying ot convey its good enough for me and 3. I prefer using alliteration when I make up words

jajajajaj: Some people just want to silence your opinion by making you miserable for sharing it in the first place, so you won't do it again in the future. They know speaking the truth is a thankless chore, while trolling you is an amusing game to them. The appearance of wanting (and yet being incapable of accepting) a rational counter argument is a carefully created illusion.

mr_perry_walker: You are not wrong but I was givin' the benefit of the doubt, I guess. 

cynoclast: Textbook strawman, my dude.

Seventytvvo: That's not a strawman. 

cynoclast: Yes it is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man

Seventytvvo: No it's not. He didn't set up a strawman, he pointed out how your reasoning is flawed.  

cynoclast: Yes, it is. From wikipedia: 

>A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, **while refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent**.

Here's the argument:

>The vast majority of the organization (manpower and money) goes to teaching people about gun safety etc.. [so they're worthwhile]

Here's the strawman

>terrible things serial killers do, alot of their time is spent just going to work and church

It's *literally* a straw man in place of what the NRA actually does.

>he pointed out how your reasoning is flawed.

Also, I'm not the guy who presented the argument. I'm just pointing out the highly upvoted fallacy.

Third_Ferguson: Why can’t you just admit that you’re wrong?

cynoclast: Because I'm not. How is that *not* a strawman? The NRA aren't serial killers who go to church.

walofuzz: Because it’s a false equivalency. 

walofuzz: It’s actually a false equivalency. 

WikiTextBot: **Straw man**

A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be "attacking a straw man".

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., "stand up a straw man") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument ("knock down a straw man") instead of the opponent's proposition.

This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery "battle" and the defeat of an "enemy" may be more valued than critical thinking or an understanding of both sides of the issue.

The_MadChemist: They don't do anything in Washington.  I-1495 passed and they went "Well fuck y'all.  Clearly your gun rights don't need protecting!"  They're still perfectly happy to demand gun ranges require membership, but not one dime of that goes to local efforts.

EDIT: I-594, not 1491.  Dyslexia's a hell of a drug.

elsparkodiablo: The NRA was outspent in Washington by antigun billionaires 7-1.  Acting like they don't spend on local issues is 100% incorrect and uninformed.

dogcatmousefroggy: It appears as if you don’t have a lot of support on this one 

karmagod13000: your getting downvotes but i def agree. i mean im sure there is a time and a place where a girl might need help, but sometimes girls over react to dudes in situations where it doesn't even apply

None: [deleted]

TheDickDuchess: You do realize some women get followed afterward right? That some men will wait for them in the parking lot? This has happened countless times to women.

shh_Im_reading: You do realize that some people rob stores. Does that mean every time someone walks into a store you should try to leave in a panic? I'm sure these people just want to see a little moderation and less paranoia in their days. I mean I'll take the down votes and say not all men.

Edit: I guess I need to take into account that the man was not being serious and was trying to be purposefully inflammatory. However, the fact that a man simply talking to a woman in public causes another woman to think she's in danger is sad. 

TheDickDuchess: lol I’m not gonna continue this conversation. You will never understand how women feel about these situations because you’ve never experienced it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

OneManGOONsquad: What about crepes tho? You skipped the best part

iSereon: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”

captainsavajo: Having a conversation in the gym is not the 'trumph of evil', Come back to reality. 

I could understand if the guy was trying to drag her out or club her over the head, but they're in a public place filled with employees. 

alicia3138: And he could easily wait outside in his car in the dark until she leaves and assault her. 

captainsavajo: That would be a much more appropriate time to intervene. I really fail to see how interjecting yourself into the conversation would prevent that but whatever makes you feel good, right? 

alicia3138: I think the issue is that if the girl feels threatened or uncomfortable or like she can’t get away for some reason then another girl comes over and helps her out. Just because there are a lot of people around doesn’t mean anyone would help. Sadly, most people mind their business which is why this stuff happens. 

captainsavajo: The issue is the presumption that the girl feels uncomfortable during the course of normal human interaction and that other people feel justified in sticking their noses into that interaction. There's nothing wrong with talking to another person. There is something wrong with attacking another person. 

Slipesame: You have to remember that, especially at the gym, guys hitting on girls often have an extra half a foot and 70 pounds on them. 

I doubt anything malicious is meant by it most of the time but I think a lot of men have some Lenny from Mice and Men thing going on where they don't quite grasp how much unwritten power they have over any random woman.

Try to imagine "if a girl I feel no attraction to is saying or doing this to me while holding a knife, do I feel threatened?"

trolarch: I get that it happens and is so shitty, but this is the airport security version of our social lives now. I feel terrible that this has happened to people, but the instances it happens are so few and far between. It’s as stupid for men to believe that all women are the same and have some insane depiction of them being bitches as it is for women to believe that all men are psychopaths and are going to murder them for being rejected

edit: I actually just realized that you're not even implying that the gym is the problem, but that men aren't allowed to ask women out anywhere, WHICH IS FUCKING INSANE

7teen38: Nope. Its not rude. It can save a life. It’s girl code.

Plus crepes arent a real threat, just put whip cream in them and some fresh fruit, roll em up and eat.

PM_ME_UR_FAV_QUOTE_: > Nope. Its not rude. It can save a life. It’s girl code.

Yeah, im sure that man was about to murder/rape her. Uh huh. It girl code to see an unattractive man ask a woman out and then immediately try and save her like he pulled a knife on her? real mature.

robdouth: I applaud the need to be cautious and I hope that every one of my four girls is as vigilant, cautious, or pairs up with a friend so this doesn't happen to them.

I do have one question on this though. I've never been that creepy guy having luckily married my high school sweetheart I dated from 18, so I'm not up on this scene, nor was I ever. I just want to know what is the difference in mindset between this over-cautiousness in this situation and someone who clutches their purse a little tighter when a black man walks by, or is more attentive on a plane if they see someone who looks middle-eastern. Is it just that this kind of profiling and assumption is socially acceptable? 

I'm not trying to be snarky or make a point, is it that this is more acceptable because the percentages are much higher so it's more of a "legitimate" fear, where even if it's rare, it's still more common than what people use to try to justify racial profiling?

AMA_About_Rampart: Crepes are absolutely a threat. To my waistline.

BlindingIrony: crepes are VERY dangerous. They might seem sweet and innocent but if you’re not careful they can be a real threat to you health! Practice pancake day safely people!!

naz2292: Some guys are just unaware of how creepy / aggressive guys can be. I myself only began to understand when my exes / gf / female friends told me about their experiences. 

amerioali: Fresh fruit is the key.

LRFE: upvoted for crepes

trog12: Gotta be careful. I accidentally punched my friends boyfriend at a party because he snuck up in a gorilla suit and squeezed her ass. Neither of us knew it was him. It worked out OK because I can't punch hard.

LuciusGordon: Resorting to punching a person before you even get a good look at them sounds like a great and logical thing to do where nothing could go wrong. Keep up the good work.

teh__Doctor: Uuuh but what if she was scared? Like as a guy, if someone snuck up on me in a gorilla suit I’d be sure to throw a punch in startle

milkvamp: Most awkward moment of my life was at a gay and lesbian bar with a group of gay friends and my boyfriend. He was flirting with me at the bar and a rather large lesbian stepped between us and started talking to me like we were girlfriends. 

My bf being a go with the flow kinda guy, he actually walks away! The woman shook her head and commented on how annoying it is that men come to lesbian bars to hit on us. I felt so united with her in that moment it was hard to tell her the truth 

Dissidentures: i wouldn't hold her in too high regard, she was probably just hitting on you too

Captnwoopypants: I imagined zarya

GrinsNGiggles: This is the best story I've read on this post.  I can stop now.

Thank you for sharing the hilarity

DxGxAxF: What a fucking hero.  She saved you from a threat that only existed in her own head.

dpwtr: This.

Beejsbj: Well it is a gay bar. So she's probably seen it happen for real.

DxGxAxF: Seen a man flirt with a woman?  The horror!

Particularly in today's world, how would you know that the man wasn't trans or vice versa?  

Beejsbj: I mean it's a similar situation to the main post except potentially being a bit more annoying since she thought she was a Lesbian.

Edit. its be a similar to a guy getting hit on by another guy in a straight bar or a woman on a woman.

theseventhgod: Why do I picture Big Boo hitting on you?

WorkFlow_: Except she made some huge assumptions. Unless you were showing signs you didn't like it, she was actually being the rude over bearing person here.

Copious-GTea: Lesbians being rude and overbearing towards innocent men? First time I've heard of this.

_strobe: I mean... it’s a gay bar and ty probably happens all the time 

milkvamp: I guess it’s all about your attitude. Some people might have been offended, I thought it was sweet and my boyfriend thought it was hilarious. 

JulianneLesse: Yeah that is actually kind of rude and very presumptuous 

lemonman456: How do we know that the lesbian chick was probably hoping she was gay and trying to make a move herself?

Celesmeh: Look I don't wanna sound silly but the amount of men that try to hit on me at gay bars is pretty high. It's annoying, frustrating, I'm the gayest dork out there even if I don't fit your stereotype. I love women that do this, I'm usually too polite to be able to just walk away.... 

JulianneLesse: I get that, but if neither of them looked uncomfortable for all the women stepping in knows one of them could have been trans

N2O_Hero: In a gay bar?

JulianneLesse: How did they not know either of them were trans?

AnusHoldus: A lot of gay bars are like 50% gay. There’s plenty of straight and bi people there. 

It’s not like they sniff your dick at the door. You just have to be 21 to get in.

booksblanketsandtea: I mean, kinda but not really? You gotta keep in mind that gay bars are one of the *very* few places where queer people can feel safe hitting on someone of the same sex. It’s literally a space designed for people who aren’t straight - because everywhere else *is*. So I can absolutely see why that lesbian would assume that was what was happening - because it *does* happen, a lot, and it’s incredibly frustrating to have a place designed for you to be comfortable being yourself be turned into a space for others simply because they’re there cus they like the music. I have no problem with straight people going to queer bars, but I mean - it’s not there for you, it’s there to create a space where being queer isn’t the minority for once - so you kind of need to be aware of that going in? Like, a guy I know went to a gay bar with some friends and then he got offended when a guy hit on him; he had deliberately chosen to go to a gay bar, a place designed specifically to create a safe space for LGBT+ to experience the usual nightlife without the potential threat of homophobia... and this guy goes to this bar and brings that threat with him anyway, and then gets offended when people assume he’s gay (because that’s who the space is intended for).



toomanydickpics: It's a big problem in lesbian bars so i definitely understand why she did that.  

source: I used to be a bouncer. so many dudes.

Agent0fChaos: How the hell is that even an issue?

EeLitaret: Why though? Its like trying to get your macbook fixed at a windows store.

toomanydickpics: that didn't stop many men from trying and getting mad with the people a genius bar for not waiting to help them.

borkborkporkbork: You would not believe the amount of men who take lesbians as a personal challenge.

Vladdypoo: That’s so weird why would a guy ever think that’s a good idea for anything except blue balls. I guess probably porn did this

Lots42: "Can I watch?" that's why. So gross.

y8xi: As a straight guy who spent a lot of time in lesbian bars, I can assure you, I was only there because my friend is a lesbian and that's where she felt the most comfortable to drink in public. She always made sure I had a good time. Although, if I had my choice between gay and lesbian bars, I'd probably choose the gay bars. At least there I'm getting hit on, and my drinks are free. 

CGY-SS: Gay bars can be super fun as a straight dude. You get hit on constantly and there's a surprising amount of straight girls who go there with their gay friends 

y8xi: Don't get me wrong. My friend always made sure to buy me a few drinks, and find "curious" girls to introduce me to (let's face it, they were lesbians but wanted to see if they could handle messing with a guy for a night -- some could, some couldn't). I had a lot of fun. She made sure I felt included and always appreciated that. 

But gay bars are just way more entertaining. Drag shows, especially. One bar would do this call, and all of the gay guys would point out the straight guys, then the drag queens would bring us up on stage and make a show out of it. If you're a good sport, it was always hilarious and loads of fun. Very, very crude... but fun.

threwitallawayforyou: > But gay bars are just way more entertaining.

Yeah, if I was fully 100% straight I'd probably still choose gay bars over straight bars. What are you gonna do at a straight bar? Drink?

CGY-SS: Oh my god the drag shows are ridiculous! I'm not sure if it was just the particular bar or if it's common in drag but those gentlemen were brick shithouses. If burlesque didn't work out they could play D line, my god. 

None: So now you are in a happy lesbian relationship?

swr3212: Lies anyway, gay and lesbian clubs are almost always separate. It's rare to go to a club thats for both.

None: You can't let that much frumpiness around all that fabulousness.

Kittens4Brunch: No, her boyfriend came back pretending to be a stranger pretending to be her boyfriend and rescued her from the lesbian pretending to be her girlfriend.

quimicita: I think this happened on The L Word.

milkvamp: My boyfriend is so committed to a good joke, he just didn’t come back. I miss him. 

pmmelifedreams: Enjoyed.

summonsays: I'm the dude diguised as a dude playing another dude!

yagidy: ITT: Unhealthy views on everything

NorthernSpectre: Yeah, reading this thread doesn't exactly boost my confidence talking to women.

sora_phoenix: if you back off when you see that your advances are unwelcome, then you're doing it right. i appreciate the guys who make the first step, if they understand what "no" means.

Marsmar-LordofMars: Reddit is a very shitty site when it comes to figuring out what people want. There's a lot of people here who skew very far into extremes that are otherwise a super tiny minority of the overall population you'd find out in the wild. Don't let these idiots ruin your confidence. 

Captain_Arrrg: Do better than "you look nice in those leggings, can I take you out sometime" and you'll be fine.

It's a very low bar to clear.

NorthernSpectre: What if she looked nice in those leggings?

Moofooist12: Yeah it seems a bit much considering all he said was “You look nice can I take out sometime”, are guys not even allowed to ask women out anymore?

abbabbagadeeba: Nobody is saying she was saved from death, danger or rape.  She was bailed out of a creepy/awkward situation.  Plus, guys like that get clingy, they follow, and turn nasty if you ignore them.  She was heading an obvious asshole off at the pass.

NorthernSpectre: "Guys like that"? You mean guys who ask women out?...

Warpato: Can you really not understand context?

NorthernSpectre: Seems like the context was "If you ask a girl out in the gym, you're a creep". 

abbabbagadeeba: Yeah, stop stupidly pretending you can't see the difference between respectfully and in the appropriate context asking someone out, and overtly leering at someone when they're trying to work out.  Only a douchebag does that.

Like, I get opposing metoo on grounds that the accused are condemned without trial, but this other argument where you literally pretend you're too socially retarded to understand the difference between a friendly date invitation and rubbing your crotch on a subway stranger is a bizarre and unflattering tack for you to take.

GraveyardGuide: I belive the one you're responding to is interpreting a position where any advance at all is considered inappropriate, not just the justifiably so situations.

It's unfortunately not an uncommon opinion on the topic.

abbabbagadeeba: It’s a deliberate tactic- straw manning the metoo movement.

GraveyardGuide: Not at all.

brbvengful: The gym really isn't the place to do that. And yet it happens a lot. Any save from these uncomfortable situations is appreciated.

timesquent: See I've just given up on expressing interest at this point. If it works out maybe I get a date, if not I get accused of sexual assault or harassment. Why run that risk? No date is worth the potential of 5-10 years 

vnotfound: Ugh.

Rentalsoul: I think your decision is in everyone's best interest.

dogcatmousefroggy: If the concept of “flirt with and ask out women only when it’s appropriate” is so difficult for you, then throwing your hands up and saying “fine I’ll just never talk to women again I guess” is probably the best outcome for everyone. 

Marsmar-LordofMars: I like how you used the exact logic of some people in the thread (It doesn't happen most of the time but it does happen so stay safe) and you're getting downvoted. 

trolarch: I feel bad for you that you think asking someone out could potentially get you thrown in jail. Maybe you’re just asking the wrong way if this has even the potential to happen,

rsqejfwflqkj: Seriously. After you say No, you're then stuck next to this dude for the rest of your workout, and possibly all future workouts. And guys who aren't aware that the gym is the wrong place to approach like that are probably not fully up to speed on other social conventions and personal interactions, so shit's probably going to get weird.

trolarch: I’m pretty sure someone who is confident enough to go up to someone and ask them out is not the one that lacks social skills. And so what, if I got turned down, I’d be riding the high that I actually asked and wouldn’t pay any attention to that person. Plus you immediately have something of interest in common. Is the only place that you’re allowed to speak to women at the bar at this point?

NorthernSpectre: Man you nailed it, asked this chick out, got a no, but man it felt great. We exchange smiles and hellos every so often when I see her. It's not awkward at all.

Moofooist12: Why though? It’s a very casual public place, surrounded by people, lol if the guy takes a “no” badly it’s not like much can happen. 

brbvengful: Look, I don't want to be hit on anywhere I'm not in the mood to be social. This includes the gym, the grocery store, the park if I'm on a walk by myself, a parking lot, a cafeteria, the airport, the mall, the gas station, the sidewalk. *I'm not there for you to talk to.*


If I'm in a social class (like yoga), participating in a game night or out at a bar that might be a different scenario. Obviously, it depends. And I'm not really someone that wants to be asked out immediately. I like the slow burn of getting to know another person through similar hobbies and interests -- hence the social situations. 

I'm never a fan of randos talking to me just because they want to. It's rude. I'm usually doing my own thing, minding my own business. Don't make me pause my music. 

I went on a bit of a rant there. Sorry. It's just really frustrating that some men don't seem to understand this. It's to the point where I prefer walking down the street with sunglasses and ear buds in just so I don't make accidental eye contact that invites unwanted conversation. 

DxGxAxF: Tough titties, the world isn't gonna be molded into your perfect place?  Take it in stride and move on with your day.

Throwawaysantamonica: That's *you* though

I'm sorry that you're constantly bothered I feel for you and I'm not being facetious but a random proposition on the street is how I met my fiancee

That's how adults meet.  Im curious as to why you think society should cater to you and I'm saying that without the least bit of aggression 

I'm just genuinely curious as to why you think you speak for all women 

brbvengful: I never said I speak for all women. That's specifically why I used "I" throughout my response... 

It's just my experience, but if you read many of the other comments, other women in the thread share at least some of my opinions.


Throwawaysantamonica: No I can see that a little better and it's troubling to see some of the vicious responses.  

It just gets to a place where one begins to wonder where *is* the appropriate place?   

If not the market or the park or the gym.  

A bar?  What if you don't drink?  I'd just hate for things to get to a point where men and women are only communicating on Tinder

brbvengful: If I *want* to meet people, I find social activities that encourage that. Such as joining a climbing group or other networking function in the community. There are lots of social functions and organizations that make meeting others fun and less stressful. 

When it comes to meeting people, I think it comes down to interests first. 

If you see a woman at the gym and you really feel like there is a possibility of it being more, waiting until she's done with her workout and to let her know you were impressed by her form for example, instead of the way she looks, and then you ask how long she's gone to the gym -- that's a much different conversation than *can I have your number?* At this point, she'll be able to clearly communicate either through body language or clear vocal cues she's not interested in a conversation.

Still, for many women, it's been instilled in us that we must *always* be polite and smile when being talked to. If we don't smile, we're often told to smile. So.... Yes, it's complicated. But it isn't just complicated for men. 

Also, thank you for your rational response. :)

GraveyardGuide: That's, uh, that's a little long, buddy. I'm more tolerant of walls of text than the next, but I still recommend you trim that.

JuicyJuuce: >Still, for many women, it's been instilled in us that we must always be polite and smile when being talked to. If we don't smile, we're often told to smile.

I think that ultimately this is the heart of the issue. If what you are feeling is not a smile, don't give a smile. That doesn't mean be mean, but there is nothing wrong with a cool and disinterested "no thanks."

Said another way, you feel an internal conflict between a pressure to be nice and a desire to express anger. The fact that you feel the pressure to be nice just makes your desire to express anger even stronger. If you give yourself the freedom to not appear pleasant in these situations&mdash;to not care what strangers think of you&mdash;then having to say no will be much less stressful.

I think this is why other people responding are frustrated. Being told not to flirt with girls unless in a designated social context is extremely restrictive.

dalagrath: Holy shit your viewpoint is skewed. Nobody is going to read your mind. That is the fallacy in this thread. The simple assumption that all people regardless of gender or race will know at all times every boundary or rule you set is asinine. Nobody owes you anything, and you owe nobody else anything.

> I'm never a fan of randos talking to me just because they want to. It's rude.

This part is the most sickening to me. It's rude to talk to a stranger? How the fuck did your parents or your parent's parents form relationships? Through the magic of wired cups? 

Get out of your safe zone, get uncomfortable, and grow. Stop stifling yourself and others in this thread by spewing vitriol such as this.

dogcatmousefroggy: >lol if the guy takes a “no” badly it’s not like much can happen

My dude have you met men before?

Moofooist12: I’m talking specifically in a public place like a gym, obviously if a guy is asking you out in a dark alley there’s some massive red flags, but that’s not what this is about.

ALIttleLonelyStar: Angry men will wait and stalk a woman after she leaves. It happens. :/

PM_ME_BEAR_GIFS: And crazy women boil bunnies. Bad things happen

Moofooist12: Exactly, constantly living in fear of what MIGHT happen instead of just living your life sounds awful lol.

cakecakecakes: Gyms still have parking lots, and people can hide behind cars. Especially if it's dark. Before anyone asks if that's actually a fear women have - yes. Emphatically yes, it is a fear that women have, I have discussed it with my friends before. You might feel oblidged to nice conversation when a woman is trying to spend time by herself working out, and if she says no you might feel butthurt and stop - cool. Not every dude will stop, some will just make plans for later.

DxGxAxF: What place doesn't have a parking lot where a pyscho can hide and do nefarious things?  A gym is no different than a bar or any other social activity in that regard.

Dollface_Killah: I think the problem is that in cities, where you encounter an inordinate amount of strangers every day, attractive women get hit on *constantly*. That's why some press for a social shift towards sexually/romantically agressive behaviour being confined to 'designated' places like bars.

AWinterschill: >That's why some press for a social shift towards sexually/romantically aggressive behaviour being confined to 'designated' places like bars.

Oh dear God.

Designated flirting areas?

"We would like to remind our customers that, in accordance with city by-laws, this is a no flirting zone. Unless you are seated in the red, I repeat: *red*, tiled area; all eye contact must be limited to 1 second or less, conversation must be restricted to sports or the weather and holding a straw in your mouth for more than 4 seconds is strictly prohibited."

What if you meet someone you're interested in and you happen not to be in a designated place? 

Perhaps you could engage in some kind of vague, non-threatening dance to indicate that you are interested in some non-specific person in the area. Then anyone who might reciprocate could move directly to a designated flirting zone.

This is the worst idea ever.

Marsmar-LordofMars: Be sure to read only from the pre-approved list of acceptable flirtations. Voices must be kept to a minimum to ensure no flirtation is heard outside of the flirtation zone. Remember that the flirtation zone is for flirtation only and no romantic pursuits are allowed outside of the flirtation zone. 

Remember to stay safe!

dalagrath: It's perfectly okay to say hello at the gym to form any type of relationship (friends, workout buds, romantic eventually if it works out, etc.) If they don't want you around, they have a mouth and mind to say so. Don't listen to this ridiculous viewpoint.

Xandralis: it's just an out to an awkward situation

PM_ME_UR_FAV_QUOTE_: I feel like any grown adult should be able to handle this on their own.

Xandralis: yeah, and they can, but it's nice to get help. 

andyzaltzman1: >The gym really isn't the place to do that.

How is the gym different than any other public location?

banquuuooo: Cause most people go to the gym to concentrate and not be social, unlike most public places. 

andyzaltzman1: Or maybe, just maybe, they don't view the gym the same as you do?

GraveyardGuide: I don't have to have my carcher's mitt to catch a baseball.

ThatRaggedyMan: Seriously, all these people asking why it's weird have obviously never been to a gym.

vnotfound: I've been to a gym lol it's just that if I don't have headphones on there's a 99% chance I'll be cool if you talked to me or flirted with me. 

But then again I'm a guy so I guess it's not the same?

andyzaltzman1: Or maybe, just maybe, they don't view the gym the same as you do?

NorthernSpectre: I asked a girl out in the gym. I thought she was cute and said if she wasn't busy I'd like to get her number. She told me she had a bf so I told her no worries, and that it's always nice getting compliments anyway. I mean, I never really see the girl outside the gym, where else am I suppose to ask her out?

onepunchdog: Yeah it’s not exactly one sided, the context of the situation matters. If you see her at the gym often and you guys talk and connect, why not try to ask her out? I’d like to say the worst thing she can do is say no, but I guess the worst she can do is pretend you’re a creep.

NorthernSpectre: Yeah, it would be pretty humiliating to be portrayed as a creeper by having a random girl pretend to know her to get her out of an "awkward" situation where I'm simply asking her out. 

vnotfound: I was wondering the same thing and it's so weird to see you get downvoted. She needs a rescue because a guy said "can I take you out sometime"? Is that frowned upon now? Since when? 

I'm sure we're missing something here.

GraveyardGuide: The tone, probably.

SrWiggles: There are a couple things about this exchange that could raise red flags. 

The first was "you look good in those leggings", which to many (but obviously not all) woman is *not* taken the same way as "You look nice". Because of how leggings are worn, that statement isn't the same as "That shirt looks really good on you". It's much closer to "Your legs and ass look great!" Hopefully you can see that being sized up that way in a casual situation where you might not be looking for someone is uncomfortable. Now obviously, this could change depending on context, social situation, and the people involved.

Second (and this is something we can't know from the tweet) the guy could have been saying this line in a creepy/sleazy voice. This would only throw more red flags up for the bystander. Again, we can't know this for sure, but given the joke being made, it's pretty reasonable to assume.  

This is only to say why this situation might have raised red flags, and to point out that "you want to go out sometime" likely wasn't what did it.

vnotfound: This comment is so white I love it. "Technically speaking it could theoretically have meant something else plus the voice could have been sleezy and this could be a giant red flag..."

I mean I get your arguments don't get me wrong. It's absolutely possible. He could have been an obvious sleezeball or he could have been charming. We just weren't there to assess things truthfully. 

That being said, this "technically it's possible that he could have been a douche and depending on the context it could eventually have meant it's a red flag" argument is just cracking me up for some reason.

ThatRaggedyMan: Also it's at the gym, the one place where people shouldn't be afraid of their bodies attracting unwanted attention. Everyone is there for the same thing, and that's to promote their physical health.

Ghost_Qbert: Except they may only be at the gym for themselves, not for you to check the out.

GraveyardGuide: People will be checked out whether they want to or not.

Ghost_Qbert: That doesn't mean you should do it too.

GraveyardGuide: It is no sin. Just don't be excessive.

TheManWhoWasNotShort: I believe that's what he's saying. You shouldn't have to worry about being harassed about your appearance at the gym 

Zanford: half the comments: "...this girl nearly got my arrested or beat up for a laugh. LOL she's so great! She respects me so much!"

i_am_banana_man: Funny women exist, what a shock

Zanford: You sound like a really Nice Guy

i_am_banana_man: I'm not.

onepunchdog: Women are smart and funny, get over it.

LRFE: I JUST WANTED THE KARMA

EndGame410: Respectable

rh1413: I kinda did what the random girl was trying to do, but it was just some asshole yelling at some old lady when we both walked in front of him driving in a parking lot for the grocery store. And I called him out for yelling at the old lady not the giant bearded guy. And started yelling back and he just drove off. I’ve wanted to tell the story for karma, but the worst thing happened next. 

Some lady actually drove by and rolled her window down and started clapping. I literally thought to myself “I can’t tell that part to anyone because no one will believe me”

Sir_Squidstains: Then you found $50?

metrenome: And now you've started an argument. Was it worth it /u/LRFE ? Are you happy with what you've wrought?

craniumhead2: What argument? Do I need to sort by controversial?

LRFE: I'm surprised this even hit r/all because that's when shit hits the fan.

Defenestranded: Suddenly it all makes sense - /r/all is the fan, and literally everything on this site is shit o_o

AxisFifa: *makes r/all a few hours later

ninjapimp42: Its a nice story where nobody was an asshole and everybody came across well. Yet Reddit makes it controversial. 

LRFE: I tried posting to r/wholesomememes and they removed the submission :(

robhol: And why not? It's not a meme. Hell, even the people who think "meme" means "funny picture" wouldn't think so.

Cylon_Skinjob: I remember sitting outside holding my then girlfriend now wife's hair back while she puked (up her third shot. Small girl) at least 5 people came by to ask her if she needed help/asking if I was bothering her. 

The little things give you faith sometimes.

mathswarrior: pretty fucked up society in which you see a man holding a woman's hair back while she puked and you immediately think he might be harming her in some way, am I right?

also, I wonder how it would be the other way

oj-did-it: >pretty fucked up society

It is. Because of men. Hard to complain as a tall white dude about the oppression though. Luckily I think kids and drunk sorority girls are annoying, so I'm usually ok.

hsalFehT: stop with this shit. 

you're just making things worse. 

when you see a man holding a woman's hair while she pukes your first thought shouldn't be that he's harming her. 

if you see one dragging a woman's limp body off to their van or down a dark street then sure ask him some questions. but if you're going to harass every couple you see that's been drinking that's gonna be a long night. 

oj-did-it: Hey I'm not saying it's right, but men are the violent and rapey half of humanity, downvote all you want. I don't really see the point in complaining about something that won't change, like biological reality.

I do think it's unfair that I can't walk through a park without getting the stink eye from mothers with their kids. That is complete bullshit, and an unfortunate reaction to sensationalist news.  But mens' basic character vis a vis women is a whole other story.

hsalFehT: >Hey I'm not saying it's right, but men are the violent and rapey half of humanity

you think so huh? 

I guess you've never reviewed the cdc numbers on rape then have you? 

http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/

go ahead. give it a read. it has a lot of info. 

>After all, very few men in the CDC study were classified as victims of rape: 1.7 percent in their lifetime, and too few for a reliable estimate in the past year. But these numbers refer only to men who have been forced into anal sex or made to perform oral sex on another male. Nearly 7 percent of men, however, reported that at some point in their lives, they were “made to penetrate” another person—usually in reference to vaginal intercourse, receiving oral sex, or performing oral sex on a woman. This was not classified as rape, but as “other sexual violence.”

>And now the real surprise: when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).

>In other words, if being made to penetrate someone was counted as rape—and why shouldn’t it be?—then the headlines could have focused on a truly sensational CDC finding: that women rape men as often as men rape women.


just cause its not talked about. and just cause its called something else, doesn't mean that it doesn't happen to men too. 

calling one gender the rapey half of humanity is fucked.  and really ignorant


> I don't really see the point in complaining about something that won't change, like biological reality.

so given what you just learned would you like to adjust this opinion at all? 



oj-did-it: Christ are you some kind of red piller? Men commit 96% of homicides worldwide. Violent rape? Assault? Men and men.

Name a violent crime, name a country and it's 80%+ men commiting that crime. And guess who are the most likely victims of domestic assault? Not men!

How deep does your head have to be in the sand to not recognize the plainest fact on Earth. Men suck. We've always sucked, and until CRISPR changes our gene line, we are stuck with what intelligent design gave us.

Anywho. Sorry you are so oppressed. Boo hoo and all that. 

hsalFehT: jesus you're pretty ignorant. 

its sad really. 

there is nothing inherently wrong you friend. you don't need gene therapy to fix you. 

Stat-Arbitrage: New gene’s no. Therapy maybe. 

hsalFehT: do you feel violent uncontrollable urges to rape and murder your fellow men and women? 

why do you think you need new genes?

mathswarrior: Distinction from what?

mathswarrior: Exactly, totally agree

qtipsandnippleflicks: Id be pretty pissed off if people kept thinking I was harassing someone just because I'm a dude

subzero421: Bums me out how this thread is going. "Look at that man helping that woman, he must be a rapist!". 

If woman are so vulnerable when they get blacked out drunk in public then they probably shouldn't get blacked out drunk in public. I know everyone is going to get mad and tell me "Woman have ever right to get blacked out drunk and not get raped.". I agree that you do have that right but if there is as great of a chance of being raped when you are blacked out drunk then you might want to reconsider that behavior. I have the right to leave my car on the bad side of town unlocked with the keys in the ignition but I personally wouldn't do that because that type of behavior can lead to my car being stolen and I don't want my car stolen. 

Jambuddle: Those women could have been drugged.

subzero421: How come no one has done any studies on drugged drinks? I found some "studies" that were really just surveys where they asked college people if they have ever been drugged. I am not sure why some researchers haven't gone out to bars and tested drinks for drugs or at least tested people for drugs in their system from their drinks if this is as common as people claim it is. 

That being said I just don't think that many people are getting their drinks drugged. It just is counter productive for a sexual predator to spike someone's drink with Rohypnols("roofie") because they would only have 10-15 minutes before that person loses all control of their motor functions. There are other drugs that can be used like benzodiazepines but still the logistics for drugging a random persons drink in public and then getting them somewhere secluded to rape them would be difficult at best. Drugging random people's drink is just not an effective or efficient way to rape people if that is the sexual predators goal. Now if someone took someone else out on a date and spiked their drink then the logistics would be much easier but doing that to a random person in a bar just wouldn't work out well.

I'm sure there are tons of people who will chime in and say "I've been drugged at a bar before so I know it happens.". But they will have no evidence(like a drug test) and their symptoms will be the exact same symptoms as heavy alcohol consumption. 

Sir_Squidstains: I have heard dozens of girls use the drink spiked excuse after explaining a crazy night. For a while I believed them. Until I actually got my drink spike in Thailand. Your on a whole new fuckin level when your drink is spiked. I came to my senses about 16hrs later. My memory was so vague and fuzzy and I had lost my phone camera and wallet. There was blood all over my hands and knees from falling over constantly. I had no recollection of anything and all I wanted to do all day was vommit. My most vivid memory was after having one drink. After that everything just went blackout.

That shit is brutal, so after that when I hear stories of friends who just had a few too many shots I can tell tlafter a few questions whether they have had a big alcohol furled night, or a drug spiked night. ( Although you can actually spike a drink with alcohol not always drugs) it's a good excuse though, your not even taking the blame for any of your actions after you drop that excuse.

Purehappiness: I mean, rapists typically aren’t exactly the most logical people, and typically don’t care that much about how good the sex is. 

Also, as someone in college, I’ve seen people try to drug my friends drinks, both a woman and a man, so it’s not exactly none existent.

Finally, none of these examples have been aggressive.  They’ve all either been asking or inserting in such a way that the person who could be being attacked is able to say that they’re fine.  If someone just outright punched someone over this, I would agree that they’re in the wrong, but none of this is harmful stuff.

subzero421: >I mean, rapists typically aren’t exactly the most logical people, and typically don’t care that much about how good the sex is.

Rape isn't about sex. If a rapist MO is too drug random people's drinks at the bar with the intent to rape them then they probably wouldn't be successful raping very many people and wouldn't have a very long raping career because it would be to easy to catch them. The rapist would have to drug multiple people drinks at a bar with the hopes of being able to successfully isolate one of them without any seeing(or cameras recording). Drugging multiple people at a bar would be very obvious to the bar employees when they see 10% of their customers fall out on the floor after 1 or 2 drinks. If that happens then the bar employees could review the security tapes and easily find the person who is putting drugs into people's drinks.

> Also, as someone in college, I’ve seen people try to drug my friends drinks, both a woman and a man, so it’s not exactly none existent.

Did you call the cops? 

I can't find any records of people being arrested for spiking random peoples drinks in public. If it was as common as people claim then people would be arrested all of the time. You said it yourself that rapist are not the smartest or most logical. https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1LENP_enUS753US753&ei=BIODWqz7Fo_ZzwKIkavgCA&q=spiked+drinks+arrest&oq=spiked+drinks+arrest&gs_l=psy-ab.3...13679.14482.0.14987.6.6.0.0.0.0.150.538.4j2.6.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.2.222...0i8i7i30k1.0.6zvGjPFYsZc

Purehappiness: Rape is about power and primal wants, not logic.  If someone wants sex, and is logical, they would just date under their league, or they’d work on themselves.  Similarly, if someone passes out away from their friends, they can be very easily “escorted” out.  Also, even assuming the cameras are good enough to show that, what about at parties?  Finally, you’re incorrect on how most date rape drugs work. Typically they induce a state of extreme drunkenness within 10 minutes, but it can be a variable amount of time before the person passes out, even assuming the person does.

Secondly, no, I didn’t.  I’ve thought about if I should, but I caught the first person in the act, so we just threw the drink out and decided we’d just finish out drinks before going back out.

Cylon_Skinjob: I remember being a little annoyed but you have to balance it with the other thought. What if I wasn't there and somebody was trying to take advantage? Made me feel good to know random strangers had the best interests of another random stranger in mind, regardless of how it did or did not make me feel at the time.

Vladdypoo: I appreciate that because if my gf was out with her friends and I wasn’t there I’d want people to do the same thing.

Thinkpolicy: Had the cutest gf in HS, we had this nice casual drive up to this scenic overview in the mountains.  We get out to take a little hike and there’s a nice family with little kids. As we get out of the car, she suddenly screams “I hate you! Why do you always treat me that way!!?” And then ran down the hiking trail alone. 

I was standing there paralyzed and the entire family just glared at me forever.

Man, I sure miss her. 


djskunkybeerz: Wow what a weird way to break up with someone 

Thinkpolicy: It wasn’t a breakup. She was pranking me.  

Kurigohan-Kamehameha: I think we need more of this story for it to make sense

Thinkpolicy: She was joking. She was laughing her head off when I finally caught up with her. 

upular21: >Man I miss her

Feel free to ignore this question, but if you don’t mind me asking, why did you too separate?

Thinkpolicy: We eventually stopped dating when she went through some emotional issues. We’re both married with kids but still friends. 

upular21: Ok thanks for the response. And sorry for prying!

ficcionella: Yes! I love seeing this! A woman “rescued” me from a creeper at the gym last year & ever since I’ve tried to pay it forward pretty vigilantly, mostly when men are cornering women on the train or following/catcalling them on the street. I was a little nervous the first time I did it but now I feel empowered. Gotta look out for one another, ladies!

Edit: after reading some of these comments... just don’t hit on women at the gym. It’s really fucking uncomfortable for us. Why do we have to elaborate any further on this? 

EllipticPeach: I was once convinced by a friend to join a gym she went to. When we were working out together I met her personal trainer and we all had a conversation and joked about a bit, then I got back to my workout and thought nothing more of it. Then in the middle of the next week I get a text from an unknown number telling me we had "chemistry" and he "hadn't stopped thinking about me". My friend had given this guy my number even though she knew I had a boyfriend, I was fucking furious. I politely declined his offer of a date and he tried to pass it off as a joke, but even if it was a joke, it made me super uncomfortable and i didn't go to that gym many more times after that.

kAy-: This thread is going crazy, but honestly, it would be more accurate to say "don't hit on girls if you're not attractive". Because the reality is, no matter where or when it is, women don't mind as much getting hit on if the guy is attractive. Some are obviously not like that, but the vast majority is. Better to be honest.

ficcionella: For me personally, even when I was single, I was uncomfortable when hot dudes hit on me at the gym all the same as the less attractive. I’m at the gym man! I’m sweaty, I’m smelly, I’m pushing myself & wearing headphones so I’m probably a mouth-breather. I am NOT in any sort of mood to flirt, I just want to de-stress after a long day & focus on self-care.

BordeauxFrog: It's possible to flirt or talk to women at the gym without being uncomfortable or creepy you know

ficcionella: I have made some male acquaintances at the gym who don’t hit on me ever. Not everyone who talks to me is hitting on me. I know the difference.

BordeauxFrog: I was not implying that you don't know the difference. I was stating that it is possible for men to hit on women at the gym without it being uncomfortable. You were making a statement about all women finding it uncomfortable, which is wrong. There's plenty of women who don't mind, several who I know personally, while there's also plenty who would rather not have it happen. If you don't like it fine, but don't tell men what to do on behalf of all women.

ficcionella: I’m sorry but I am standing my ground on this one. More women dislike being hit on at the gym than do enjoy it. I’m glad for those who do, more power to em.

BordeauxFrog: This is absolute madness. What about we encourage men to use their social awareness and good sense like in any other social interaction instead of just dismissing normal human behaviour and telling men what they can and can not do.

ficcionella: Your response to not hitting on women at the gym is essentially “don’t tell me what to do”? 

sienacuen: Me, I can't relate because something being "fucking uncomfortable" doesn't make it harmful or bad. 

In fact, when I'm at the gym I'm hating it for the whole hour and only later I get to feel better(when the endorphins kick in).

So if the argument is don't do it because it's uncomfortable(to you in this case), I would need more clarifications to understand it

Rentalsoul: You go to the gym and make yourself uncomfortable to feel better. Women don't go to the gym for *other people* to make them feel uncomfortable.

ficcionella: Making a woman feel uncomfortable isn’t enough reason not to do it?

Oftentimes when a woman is made uncomfortable by a man’s behavior, that translates into feeling unsafe. There are degrees to this feeling. I’m not saying that we cry rape in the cardio section if a man says hello, but there are types of attention, when unwanted, that are distressing or agitating. 

I’ve had men follow me to my car, wait for me outside the locker room. It doesn’t always end when we reject the flirtation, & it’s important to note that it’s common for these men to become vicious, even violent, upon receiving that rejection. Why put her in this situation? Even if you’re “one of the nice ones” we don’t know that, we’ve seen some *shit*, & most of us would prefer a safe haven to exercise without having to worry about it.

sienacuen: Thanks for the thorough answer.

I think what you're describing is the stranger-danger sentiment. I totally understand how it works, but still, it does not seem sustainable to try and avoid interaction with anyone(or any male in the gym), because of bad past experiences. 

It seems to me that if there is such high fear or discomfort when being asked out in a gym, maybe the only safe haven is working out at home. A gym is a public place, after all, and it is expected that people will interact freely. Or at least that is my expectation as a non-American.

So to me, if the dichotomy is between not asking out in fear that the girl will feel afraid, or allowing people to ask out each other with the discomfort that comes out from rejecting and being rejected, I'd side with the latter. The other option feels like avoidance and dystopia to me

Gr8tUnfinishdSymphny: Are you serious right now? "Maybe if men are making you uncomfortable in a public place, you should just stay home?" Get tf outta here. Maybe you should have some decency and leave them alone. They aren't there for you.

Zibini: Lol they might not be there for you, but how exactly are people supposed to meet potential partners if we don't put ourselves out there? 

This whole concept of women not being allowed to feel uncomfortable is nonsense, men have to feel pretty uncomfortable asking women out because women almost never ask men out but you don't hear us complain, do you?

Life is uncomfortable sometimes, suck it up and stop being a pussy. 

ficcionella: [haha edit, random note unrelated to this removed]

You have valid points! I didn’t mean to create the narrative that debilitating fear is triggered in every woman who is approached by a man. Obviously those cases are pretty extreme, & nobody is expecting you to mind-read another person’s traumas.

Of the few interactions I’ve had on this post where the person wasn’t attacking me - which, telling in itself, is a small minority - I’ve learned a little about the opposition’s perspective to my blanket demand that men don’t hit on women at the gym. I understand why they tell me it’s unfair, & I agree.

A couple times I’ve been asked out at the gym, & it was a fleeting moment that didn’t ruin my workout. I say no thank you, they nod, it’s over. I still see one of these men around actually & we smile at each other. I have never been upset by a man hitting on me when it’s this uneventful, nor am I rude to them simply for giving it a shot.

More frequently, a man hitting on a woman at the gym looks like any combination of: the man stalking her from area to area, making lascivious remarks that are more crude than complimentary, predatorily staring at her, going off on her for being a “bitch” if she’s not interested. Now she probably gets to avoid this dude whenever she goes to the gym. Forget even being scared of him- it’s a distraction & it’s obnoxious.

Look at this thread. It’s probably 90% volatile reactions from men calling me a cunt. These are the people who are hitting on women at the gym? Run for the fucking hills, these tempers are toxic.

It would be nice if the place where we work out stress could on that note be a sanctuary from interactions that so often degrade into name-calling or other threatening behavior upon rejection.

So I guess I’m saying the “bad apples” are ruining it for everyone. It’s not the woman’s fault, & it’s not the fault of the “good guys” who probably have to get through some protective barriers. That doesn’t mean women should be expected to lower them.

I know there are good men & I’m sorry if they feel like they get the short end of the stick here. In this thread of people telling me what a bitch I am, I’m truly touched by the little support I did receive from the Good Ones.

sienacuen: Thanks again for taking the time to write in detail about your position and experiences. To be honest, I haven't read the insulting comments nor I want to, given that it's hard enough to talk about this topic as an adult without receiving personal attacks.  So you got my support 100 % on that.

Fortunately, the real world is a better place than what the internet makes it look like, because there a dire stare can shame someone bitching around, be it man or woman. Here there is little incentive for not just venting and taking sides without engaging in meaningful conversation(and Reddit is probably the least bad place).

As for me, I conceptualize this thread as a hopeful experience that it's possible to engage fruitfully(despite these times we live in), with someone on the other side of the issue. I hope you can also take something positive from it :)

Cheers

NO_FIX_AUTOCORRECT: Just curious, where is a good place to try to meet someone, besides the internet or a bar/club?

I have been off the market and am not looking to meet women, but just wondering, if not the gym, grocery store, or wherever, where is the appropriate place to hit on someone these days?

cometdrop: Tinder. That's about it. 

miffet80: Anything where the activity is *social* in nature, i.e. designed specifically to bring people together to interact with each other. Go to a music show, a play, a festival, a board game meetup, take classes in a new hobby like dancing or cooking or woodworking or some shit, join a running club, a hiking or cross country skiing group, join the trivia league at your local, or see if your library has a book club, even. If someone you know is having a party or a get together that might include people you've never met, *always go*. Worst case scenario you don't meet anyone but you've done a bunch of super fun shit ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

NO_FIX_AUTOCORRECT: Thanks for a great answer

miffet80: You're welcome! Also beer leagues, dude. Soccer, softball, curling, that kinda thing (curling is awesome if you're not the super athletic type because it's mostly just standing around chatting and literally drinking beer). Lots of times there'll be rec leagues hosted by local sports or community centers etc.

Throwawaysantamonica: What if you met your girlfriend at the gym? 


You know it's pretty easy for an adult to say "you seem nice and all but I'm not interested sorry"

99.9 percent of men will take it no further than that 

ficcionella: 99.9% is absolutely not the percentage. I see where you’re coming from, but in many cases the rejection is not politely received. The fact that so many people quickly resorted to calling me names on this thread leans toward that point. However I’m glad it sounds like you personally back off without incident, so thank you!

Edit: just caught that I misread your comment a bit, didn’t mean to assume your gender!

Throwawaysantamonica: Well discussions like these can get heated and some people can't control themselves I guess and resort to name calling (admittedly this probably proved your point) but still wouldn't it be fair to say a majority would back off without incident? 

If they don't then it's absolutely appropriate for other people to step in and say "hey buddy take a hint" but this mentality that all men are ass pirates looking to pillage and loot is unhealthy. 



ficcionella: I appreciate you. I wish I could say the majority of men back off, & I understand why you’d assume that is the case if you are indeed one of the nice people who don’t lose their shit post-rejection.

In my experience, the men that back off without incident are in the minority. Maybe living in NYC has something to do with that.

Just as YOU are in the minority of people who didn’t attack me over this, if that helps paint a better picture. This entire thread is par for the course, & these are the men who wonder why we don’t want them hitting on us at the gym.

Throwawaysantamonica: I appreciate you too!  I do like to understand where people are coming from and well reading stuff like this gives me an increased sensitivity to these issues.  

It's delicate no doubt and well this discussion is an example of how toxic environments can become for women so i'm cognizant of that.

ficcionella: I swear for all the disheartening interactions I’ve had on here today, your compassion is pretty wonderfully restorative. Thank you <3

MissJill: Because you're trying to speak for all of us when you don't.

You can hit on me all the time gents.

Well, the good looking ones.

VoidTorcher: Well that's refreshingly honest.

PetrolHead99: Thank god a sane reply.

I never got a negative response for randomly hitting on girls with confidence.

MissJill: On the note of confidence

Gaston = bad

Tobey McGuire's Peter Parker = very bad

Mel Gibson in the 90's = good

ficcionella: Great! You’ll be the deterrent for those of us who hate it & we’ll send the gents your way.

None: Plenty of girls want to be hit on at the gym, by the right guy of course.  

Source: met last girlfriend at gym.

Zanford: Remember the first two rules, gentlemen

harborwolf: Can I ask, for the men here, where WOULD you like to get hit on outside of a club or bar?

I definitely get the gym thing 100%, and I'm not trying to be a jerk, just honestly curious as to the best shot to get a date because the girl is comfortable in the setting. 

Rentalsoul: Speak to women like a regular person. Like you would with someone you want to be friends with. Not hitting on them when you first meet them. If it develops more from there, cool. If not, you have a new friend, also cool. Women particularly enjoy when guys find them interesting beyond their genitals. Source: am woman

harborwolf: I'm good.

I honestly just wanted to hear some answers. 

PetrolHead99: Wrong.

You speak to women like a regular person but still in a way that clearly shows you eventually want to fuck her.

This „like friends“ thing is the whole reason why so many guys land in the friendzone.

You play this friend thing all day long and if you suddenly make a move the girl will be shocked like „whoa where did this come from? I thought we were more like friends“

I am speaking of personal experience and no amount of downvote that i will inevitably get for this opinion will change the truth.

That whole „be an alpha“ thing is true.

Rentalsoul: Hi I think you may have missed the part of my comment where I am actually a woman. You are definitely wrong.

IVIaskerade: I think you missed the part of your comment where you're telling people how you'd like it to work instead of how it does work. 

Rentalsoul: The person I replied to was literally asking a question directed at women and there are a shocking amount of bitter little boys that are very upset at the answer I gave. Sucks to suck. If y'all don't actually want a woman's opinion, perhaps don't read my comment that is an answer to a *question to women*.

PetrolHead99: That you are a women makes you even more unqualified to give your opinion as you dont have any experience in getting women.

Rentalsoul: What the fuck is wrong with you

PetrolHead99: You know the moment when people realize they lost the argument and instead start attacking the person?

Rentalsoul: There's no losing. You are trying to say you understand what women want better than women. That's not only fucking dumb but insulting to women.

PetrolHead99: The only one fucking dumb here are you and that you think every women is the same and every one of them just thinks like you that is insulting to women.

Yes i obviously understand women better than you i don't have to be a women to understand women just like i don't have to be a car to understand cars.

Rentalsoul: ew women are not objects

kAy-: But that doesn't mean much. You might be fine with it but a lot of girls aren't. But it's true that in general, if you like a girl (in a dating way, not friend way), it should be clear from the get-go. Because if it isn't, most often then not, it will become a huge issue later down the line.

Rentalsoul: No, it won't. Unless you're like 14. The friendzone doesn't exist and people who think being a friend with a woman is some sort of curse are shitty people.

kAy-: I never even talked about the friendzone (which does exist, but you wouldn't know as you're a woman who apparently doesn't do that). I talked about a woman thinking she's getting a friend when what the guy wants is more. Not making this clear at the beginning will lead to issues.

You never having experienced this doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Stop thinking your personal experience means you represent every woman on Earth.

Rentalsoul: The person I replied to talked about the friendzone. You aren't talking about the same thing as me.

kAy-: I am. My whole point is that the fact that never friendzoned anyone doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It would be like me saying that because I don't harass women, sexual harassment doesn't exist. It would be as nonsensical as what you said.

Rentalsoul: The friendzone as a concept is bullshit. Being someone's friend is not a bad thing. People who believe that are shitty people and feel entitled to sex with women just because they put in nice tokens. That was my point the entire time. My experience with relationships has nothing to do with it.

RainbowDoc: Well in my experience relationships happen by chance, so there is not a specific "place" to hit on girls.. Just live your life and you'll meet your soulmate, hopefully!

pinzet: This is bad advice. If men are not the initiators, if they don't try, then they will be alone a majority of the time as a result. Men ask out women, men have to approach. "It just happens" happens to women because men make it happen. Telling men to have a passive role in it will create bitterness and lead to what people decry as "incels" or "niceguys" because when they were given poor advice, they become bitter and sexually (as well as mentally) frustrated as it doesn't  work.

RainbowDoc: What..?

silinw: You need to stop looking for the "ultimate answers" and realize every person (man or woman) is an individual and will have different views on everything. There is no specific place to hit on someone. 

VoidTorcher: Which nicely refutes the original argument of this comment thread that a certain place isn't a place to hit on someone...

pinzet: That's not what I'm getting, what I'm getting at is that for a lot of men, it won't "just happen." Even for something baser than the noble want of love, i.e., sex, it won't happen without effort on the part of the guy. If a man does not put himself out there because he's told relationships, sex, love will happen passively, and is subsequently devoid of his desires and wants because of this advice, then its bad advice. This man may harbor resentment and bitterness which is unhealthy to all, including himself. It's ignoring the impetus put on men to approach and be dominant. There is no perfect answer, because on rare occasion, things do happen suddenly, or the relationship happens through circumstance, but for the rest of the time, in order to even have a place in the running, men should approach and at least try. This is not to say anyone is entitled to anything upon trying, but it's better advice for men than to simply wait.

silinw: Meh everyone is capable of making their own decisions and learning how to approach people respectfully. And nowadays most women approach also. Even my friend group which consists of all introverted/shy girls have all asked guys out, it's just normal nowadays. None of them would think to ask out a guy by commenting on his tight butt in shorts while he is working out though.

IVIaskerade: > nowadays most women approach also.

Ahhahhahahahahahah no

silinw: Gee I wonder why they haven't approached you. All I'm saying is every girl I know has approached a guy before.

IVIaskerade: > I wonder why they haven't approached you.

Not everyone feels the need to talk about themselves, sweetie. 

silinw: Well you're obviously speaking from experience and if you aren't then why are you giving your opinion, sweetie?

pinzet: I'm not saying to go up and say nice ass, wanna go on a date. I'm saying to simply ask women out, because while you may think it's normal for women to ask out men, the average, unremarkable guy sees a fraction of the attention that a comparable women would get. Very few guys I know get asked out or complimented because, at the end of the day, it is out of the norm.

IVIaskerade: Protip: Don't ask women about how to ask women out. They have no idea how it's done.

VoidTorcher: As I've heard quite a few times...ask the fisherman, not the fish.

zwgmu7321: My parents met at the gym, so I wouldn't consider it off limits at all. If the girl is wearing headphones and not talking to anyone, then she probably isn't into it.

I would say most anywhere is fine. I frequently see post of /r/TwoXChromosomes advising guys not to hit on them at certain locations. I've seen them complain about guys hitting on them at restaurants, bars, the gym, parks, clubs, school, and even dating apps. Guys are expected to both make the first move and not make a move at all. Sitting back and waiting for a woman to approach you will certainly lead to life of loneliness.

LetheArdor: I’m afraid to even look at women when I go to the gym so as to avoid being accused of being a creep or trying to hit on them. 

Actually this is why I avoid looking at or interacting with women anywhere I go. 

It’s better to be safe than to be in jail or seen as a creep, ya know! I can find love in my dog and music anyway!

33whitten: This. Social pariah or lonely. 

LetheArdor: Forever 

Cn_mets: You are so fucking sad.

misterwhippy: And you're rude, what's your point?

LetheArdor: Thank you! :) I’m pretty happy but I appreciate the sentiment 

RandyWiener: If you think it's too hard to simply interact with women without ending up in jail (??) or being seen as a creep, then yeah, you should probably just hang out with your dog.

LetheArdor: And I will, as I said I will, thank you for your input! 

Also it was more of a joke, what with all the possibilities, of course I have to interact with people on a daily basis, men and women. 

But, as per your advice, I’ll stick to my dog, he’s better than people anyway. 

wip30ut: as my gf says it's only creepy if the guy's unattractive. If he's hott all is forgiven. Double-standard, but human beings are ingrained to prejudge based on looks, whether in business or social situations.

TotesMessenger: I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Zanford: Always heed the first two rules

bopoll: This needs to be actively fought by women(as men are already doing) This is cruel and isolating for men. Being ugly is literally the difference between getting rewarded (with sex) and being literally arrested (for "sexual harassment") 

LetheArdor: Which is why avoid even looking haha, I could just politely smile at someone and they would be like tha fuck this ugly creep wants to rape me 

onlyonebread: I wish more people thought like you did haha

ficcionella: Oh no! I’ve had plenty of men interact with me at the gym who WEREN’T hitting on me. When I was new, a few men gave me tips while I was clearly using a machine inefficiently & now we chat a little when we see each other.

Gian_Doe: This is how I go about it at the gym, never hit on them, *unless* vibes that cannot be mistaken are given.  If in doubt, do *not* hit on them, it has to be unmistakable to the point of obviousness.  Once that line is crossed there are no take-backs, you better be really damn sure.

lemonman456: You can also just be friendly and approachable.  Any vibe can be mistaken unless a woman outright says "I'm interested in you".  But even then, she would now be the one acting "creepily".  

Just be friendly and approachable and if she's cool with that, then you can be direct and see if she'd be interested in anything romantic.  If you don't get upset when she doesn't fuck you right then and there, she'll still probably enjoy the compliment and remain being friendly acquaintances with you. She might even change her mind later since you just proved that you're not some entitled creep like lots of other guys.

LetheArdor: Yeah I’m just too wary and concerned that I will be labeled as a creep for even looking their way. Honestly I avoid looking at guys too. 



DeltaDragonxx: Yep. Especially in a world when an accusation can fuck up your life if even its found to be false, you can't be too careful

quaybored: Eh, not looking at anyone sounds a little bit too careful.  And also it actually makes you look more creepy.  You belong there, don't worry about it.

Souce: used to do that myself

None: [deleted]

nasond: I think realistically the best approach is just don't hit on girls randomly, just talk to them. People respond to casual conversation and getting to know them better than off the wall compliments and flirting. If you don't go into encounters looking for a date and more about meeting new people it'll go much better, and then maybe it'll go from there.

disgraced_salaryman: What's the difference between hitting on someone and "just talking to them"? Do y'all seriously think hitting on someone means walking up to them and saying "hey, you're hella fine, lemme get dem digits"?

nasond: You just talk with them and treat them like a person rather than a potential date. Ask them how they're doing, ask them they're name, little things. I can't fathom how all these guys try and make themselves the victim with this "can't even look at a girl anymore" shit. I understand that's not what you're saying, but if someone can't small talk and not get accused of something, either they need to work on their social skills or the girl isn't worth talking to.

misterwhippy: But why are guys going up to these girls and talking to them? Just at random? Probably not, probably because they find them attractive and want to ask them out.

disgraced_salaryman: I consider chatting with a stranger and "hitting on them" to be the same, except that with the latter, you might ask for their phone # at the end.    
    
So when I read this thread and half the people are saying "don't hit on women outside of bars" and the other half is saying "I feel like I can't talk to women without being labeled a creep", I can't help but wonder if we're all just talking past each other, without ever clearly defining the terms "creep" and "hit on". Like, the women in this thread seem to be defining "hitting on" as being overtly sexual right off the bat, while guys might think simply saying "hi" means hitting on a girl.

immortal_banana: but where am i supposed to meet women? I dont drink and women do not approach men.

ficcionella: How successful have you been hitting on the women at your gym? If it’s working for you, I mean by all means, you’re correctly reading the signs!

In regards to anyone it’s *not* going that well for, I encourage you to get creative? I don’t know, I shouldn’t have to solve that quandary for you just because I’m a woman who wants to workout unperturbed.

Zibini: Lol reading your comments you come off as a bit of a privileged cunt. "Hot men hit on me at the gym and I hate it just as much as all the uggos clammering for me!"

You're a narciccist, the world does not revolve around you being comfortable and it's not a human right to be comfortable. If you want men to be the initiaters, which is the societal status quo, then kindly shut the fuck up about your discomfort when men ask you out and you aren't interested. 

It's pathetic, really. 

ficcionella: As a woman of color from a low income background I can tell you I am sure as hell not privileged, & I’d love to know your basis for this accusation?

Because people accused me of preferential treatment towards “attractive men” who hit on me at the gym, & I countered saying I’m uncomfortable when “even attractive men” hit on me there- using self-descriptors like ‘mouth-breather’? I’m a real sweaty narcissist, am I, thinking I’m so smelly at the gym!

I say don’t hit on women at the gym & here you come with your aggression. Are you hitting on women at the gym?

You didn’t quote me just now, so your quotations are confusing.

Never in fuck did I say the world revolves around me. You sound full of hate. 

Zibini: Lmao I said you're privileged because people actually hit on you, including allegedly attractive men. Men have to put themselves out there to do so and we feel uncomfortable with it. It's a really simple concept. 

Also the fact that you have to pull the "I'm a woman of color!" card to validate yourself just furthers my point. 

You're a narciccist, plain and simple. You can say I'm full of hate all you want, you're just an obnoxious cunt.

ficcionella: Every part of me that I listed, which you mocked,  is a strike against me in the “privileged” category. This is the reason for explaining some of my heritage/background after your accusation. What is your heritage? Are you different from my background or similar?

You say it’s a “privilege” for people to hit on me? It’s not flattering when 9 times out of 10 the men become vicious & call me an obnoxious cunt for not giving them what they want or acting in accordance to their liking.

MattPH1218: As a guy, I'd also like to help a woman I see in this situation. But I feel like that wouldn't end well for anybody.

BERNthisMuthaDown: 
>just don’t hit on women at the gym. It’s really fucking uncomfortable for us. Why do we have to elaborate any further on this? 

They can't relate at all, actually. 

They tell themselves that you're just being a stuck-up bitch because you aren't honoring their presentation of Nice Guy Points™ and showering them with gratitude and affection for not being a shitty person. 

All because their over-bearing and indulging mothers taught them that chivalry and common courtesy were exceptional courtesies strictly reserved only for the kind of respectable women that their impish princes "deserve". 

These Neckbearded, Norman Bates types actually believe that you aren't being "**fair to them**", I *shit you NOT!*

veryInoffensive: Lol shut your piehole

shalosh: what about their fathers?

TrueGrey: That is some olympic-level overthinking of **most** people who just want to meet new people they're attracted to in one of the few places they regularly go that isn't filled with the same coworkers/family/subway people they always see.

Unless of course you're right, and an elaborate system of neckbeards and NGPs and mommy issues makes way more sense than if people just could learn to say "Sorry, I'm not interested" like an adult and everybody could chill the fuck out.

meekahi: Holy shit. Look at you! You're a fucking genius!

I can just tell them I'm not interested! Thank God, I literally never once thought of that.

BERNthisMuthaDown: >That is some olympic-level overthinking of most people who just want to meet new people they're attracted to in one of the few places they regularly go that isn't filled with the same coworkers/family/subway people they always see.

Only guys that don't understand how forward and uncomfortable that is for women.

andyzaltzman1: Only girls don't understand how uncomfortable it is for men to always be the ones obligated to make first contact.

BERNthisMuthaDown: It doesn't matter. I am not obliged to fuck or even speak to a sloppy, fat chick, either.

No one owes anyone else any consideration. It isn't valid if it is only given on condition. 

andyzaltzman1: Go back to white knighting, you clearly have nothing of utility to say.

BERNthisMuthaDown: Lol, that's right punk. Stay in your lane, kid. 

andyzaltzman1: Yeah... you are the adult here...

YokedHipsterDouche: > All because their over-bearing and indulging mothers taught them that chivalry and common courtesy were exceptional courtesies strictly reserved only for the kind of respectable women that their impish princes "deserve".

You're so detailed that you're projecting your subconscious and stereotyping half the population.  I think it's apparent you definitely have some unresolved issues with men.

BERNthisMuthaDown: MFW incel accuses me of issues with men when I'm a dude that women actually want to talk to because he's butthurt about getting mocked in public.

BERNthisMuthaDown: >Says the incel as he sips his mountain dew, smugly.

DJSaltyNutz: Dude...youre being really fucking weird right now

highastronaut: He has not posts about being "incel".

I think people are laughing at you right now :/

andyzaltzman1: This entire comment is more deluded than most people you'd label neckbeards.

BERNthisMuthaDown: Funny, only guys seem to think that. Funny, huh? 

andyzaltzman1: I'm a man?

Rentalsoul: Yes you are. Single guy making $90k, per your comment history.

andyzaltzman1: Hey, at least you did your research! Good for you.

Rentalsoul: ctrl+f is your friend

BERNthisMuthaDown: So what is your contrary point? Were you trying to say something, or do you just want to talk shit?

I never claimed to be a nice guy. My point stands whether I'm an asshole or not.

Stand and deliver something worth discussing or run along, because idgaf what gender you are, you're not ~~saying~~ wasting any more of my time.

BERNthisMuthaDown: Either way, nothing of consequence to say.

Zanford: Yep, that rant about Nice Guys was itself the most Nice Guy comment I've read in awhile

DJSaltyNutz: Ive dated a couple of girls from the gym...stop over reacting

Also, the rest of your comment is some weird ass projection/fantasy




trailer_park_boys: Exactly. They’re speaking in absolutes. Not every girl hates every guy that comes up and talks to them. Friendly conversation can occur at the gym between two different sexes. 

Zanford: Ironically this is the most Nice Guy comment I've read in a long time

BERNthisMuthaDown: [(salt intensifies!)](https://media1.tenor.com/images/c21d6a19423ff444f6383fda164908f2/tenor.gif?itemid=5477150)

El_Giganto: The longer I'm on Reddit, the more I think like half the people here are nazis and the other half are white knights in every worst sense of the term. 

So many people are just totally okay with sexism. Obviously a problem. Just the reactions to any girl posting anything. I think it should be okay to call them pretty, but some stuff goes so far...

But on the other hand, asking a girl out in the gym? Is this really that much of a problem to do? Why would it be so bad to ask someone out? I get it, though, most people aren't really that willing to strike up a conversation, they're working out. But if you see a girl, and she seems willing to have a chat and you enjoy the chat and you ask her out... Not a problem people. 

If she seems unwilling, just stop, but just having a conversation... Come on, why is this such a problem? When I still had a girlfriend it was no problem whatsoever to just have a conversation with another girl. Why would it be a problem? Because some people don't like talking to others? That's on you, not someone else. 

BERNthisMuthaDown: >If she seems unwilling, just stop, but just having a conversation... Come on, why is this such a problem? 

No one owes you an explanation.

El_Giganto: Is this part of the weird "entitlement" criticism on people? Can't we just be decent towards each other and respect each other? Why's the one just looking for a chat and trying to be friendly the one who's an asshole in this situation? 

No one owes you an explanation. The fuck is that mentality? If someone pretty much ignores me when I say something, I'll leave them alone, I don't need an explanation, I am not going to ask why they won't speak to me. That's fine. But saying that right now as a justification as to why it's a problem to have a conversation with others? Pff. 

BERNthisMuthaDown: 
>Is this part of the weird "entitlement" criticism on people? Can't we just be decent towards each other and respect each other? Why's the one just looking for a chat and trying to be friendly the one who's an asshole in this situation? 

Because people, in this case women, don't need to justify their right to be left alone. 

No one is owed any social courtesies for any reason. Respect is either freely given or is not respect. 

El_Giganto: What is your point with this? At no point am I saying that women need to explain themselves in any specific situation. If they don't want to have a conversation, that's fine. Goes for men as well. 

But why is it a problem when someone *does* want to have a conversation? If they try to engage and get shut down, they're looked down upon. That's my problem here. They're two vastly different things. 

It's like you people think people are just going up to girls all the time saying "hey bb want som fuk". 

BERNthisMuthaDown: Consent has to be mutual. Your feelings agent more imprudent than anyone else's, full stop. 

El_Giganto: I have no idea what this means. Aren't more important? I guess?

Still you've missed the point, though. Honestly, I'm getting very annoying vibes from you. You're either not reading my comments, or you genuinely believe that someone is creepy for wanting to have a chat and you justify it by saying it has to be mutual. Still not seeing the problem. If it's not mutual, then the conversation can stop right away. What would be the problem? 

But my feelings agent more imprudent apparently. Also a full stop. I'm really grossed out right now. Ew. 

BERNthisMuthaDown: You're misunderstanding about whether or not a girl wants to have anything to do with you, and your inability to change that fact with some imaginary, super-witty turn of phrase is why you're getting annoyed.

You have no idea that you're feelings don't invalidate or supercede anyone else's, and free association, by its very definition, **cannot be compelled**

Xujhan: We're getting annoyed because you're combining a pompous attitude with the linguistic ability of Donald Trump. The best we can gather from your barely coherent argument is that you think it's a moral affront to talk to strangers, which just makes no damn sense.

BERNthisMuthaDown: Truth hurts, android. Your tantrums are only driving more lurkers to Upvotes my original comment.

You have no power here. Everyone else is laughing at you guys, embarrassing themselves with your desperate excuses for your weird and creepy Behavior.

Xujhan: The only truth that hurts is that I have to apologize for people like you when trying to convince others to support progressive causes. I'll be a bleeding-heart liberal til the day I die, but I'm really looking forward to the wave of edgy faux-feminism dying down.

BERNthisMuthaDown: Because you are a creepy weirdo, and believe me, no one is going to miss your support. 

Join the Aryan Nation for all it matters, you will still be considered creepy and weird by most normal people. You want an apology for that? Call your mother. She's the one that raised you defective. 

Xujhan: How does that saying go? If being friendly to people is wrong, I don't want to be right. I will call my mum though, just to say thanks.

El_Giganto: Again, this is not anything I'm arguing about. I'm getting annoyed because you're fucking thick. 

Answer me this:

I want to chat with a girl. Girl gives a short answer and kinda looks away. 

I conclude, she don't want to chat. 

I leave.

Am I now a dick or a creep? No. That's what I'm arguing. 

Again. I don't need an explanation as to why she didn't want to chat. That was your original reply. This has never been relevant. Never. It's not the point duuuude. Get it through your head. Read the situation. 

THAT'S THE PROBLEM. You can't read the situation! 

BERNthisMuthaDown: No girl gaf that you can't figure them out. I don't owe you an explanation for anything. You are a complete stranger, and if she wanted to have a conversation you wouldn't need to read into anything.

You don't get a lot of practice talk in the girls, I'm guessing? Am I in the ballpark?

El_Giganto: >No girl gaf that you can't figure them out

What does this sentence mean?

>I don't owe you an explanation for anything.

Never claimed you did. But when you're a decent human being, being nice to each other should be a given. So if someone strikes up a conversation, you don't need to explain yourself, but we can all be polite about it and then everything is fine. 

>You are a complete stranger, and if she wanted to have a conversation you wouldn't need to read into anything.

What is your point? What if she didn't want to have a conversation? What if she did? At both times, I didn't imply anything disrespectful, right?

>You don't get a lot of practice talk in the girls, I'm guessing? Am I in the ballpark?

Why attack me suddenly? Sorry, but I don't think you get a lot of practice talking to... anyone...? I'm not even guessing at this point. You've been a right cunt honestly. 

BERNthisMuthaDown: Then stay the fuck away from me, you fucking weirdo. The whole point is no one wants you robots forcing us to interact with you at all, for any reason.

 That's why you're so salty and bitter. Sack the fuck up and stop being soft as baby shit. 

El_Giganto: Man you're a fucking creep. You never want to talk to any man for any reason? Yeah you have issues. 

BERNthisMuthaDown: I'm a dude, stop dick-eating. Men aren't supposed to act like toddlers. 

El_Giganto: Yeah this is going to be my last reply. I feel kinda ashamed I have insulted you. I think you're a very negative person. I genuinely feel sorry for you if this is really how you act in the world. I hope you can find peace either by not communicating with people if that's your wish, or by learning how to talk with people that you're not so upset from someone willing to have a conversation with you. Makes me surprised you even comment here at all, but you do you. 

Sorry for swearing at you. I'm just genuinely quite upset that you don't understand that having a conversation with someone should be perfectly normal. If you don't want to have a conversation, that should be resolved by just respecting each other. I'm sorry you feel different about this and I hope you don't hurt anyone because you disagree with that. 

BERNthisMuthaDown: Yeah, no, you're one of those people that has to have the last word. If you are an adult, no one should have to explain to you why no one owes you any consideration of any sort, anywhere, for any reason yeah, that can be used to compel people to do anything against their own free will. You wishing that other people's feelings were different is delusional and just doesn't matter in normal social interactions, at all.

You got upset because everything you read is 100% accurate oh, and you can't help but realize that you are exactly the type of dysfunctional person that I have described.

Normal people get this without having to be forced to admit it. We are a society with standards, you don't get to just make up your own.

El_Giganto: Nah. You're chatting nonsense. Having a conversation with someone shouldn't be a problem. Flirting with someone isn't a problem either. If someone doesn't appreciate it, then just stopping should mean that you're a normal person. If it ends there, no harm. 

Nothing you said was accurate. Most of it was irrelevant. Most of it was really negative. Most of it doesn't happen in real life at all. In real life, most people can have a chat without knowing each other at all. 

Today I had a class with people I didn't know, because they were from other classes. I chatted up a girl. I chatted up a dude. Nothing wrong with that. 

Like your irrelevant rantings, it's something you gotta look into dude. No one owes you an explanation? Still not sure where exactly that is coming from. I've asked you to elaborate repeatedly, but all it boils down to is you regurgitating the same statements, that I asked you to elaborate on. 

Sure I want the last word, but so do you. That's why you keep posting the same negative stuff over and over again. I see you insult me again here by calling me dysfunctional, but I won't let you get to me this time. It's fine if you think I'm dysfunctional. It's fine that you think talking to people is bad. I don't agree. I think that's a healthier look at live. A more mature one. 

Also, it's not delusion to wish other people had different feelings. It's literally acknowledging that things are different than you want them to be. That's pretty much the opposite of delusion. Then again, pretty much everything you say is wrong. 

andyzaltzman1: He is a Bernie fan that doesn't have any political fights to pick right now so he is moonlighting as a white knight.

El_Giganto: I quite like Bernie myself, though. 

shh_Im_reading: Well to be fair, with this kind of rhetoric everywhere and "nice guys" being plastered all over the internet, it makes it seem like more prevalent of an issue than it is. It also makes it hard to distinguish between guys that are just being polite and the "nice guy" assholes that everyone loves to hate.

I'm sure there are women and men alike that don't want to be approached by any stranger in the gym (whether for friendly conversation or romantic interest). But this doesn't mean that we need to assume that being approached is creepy/wrong by default. Issues like this as a whole make me worry because it feels like nobody is willing to trust their fellow citizens to just not commit crimes against them. Are we really all that cynical/paranoid? 

Rentalsoul: Speak to more women about this. This is incredibly prevalent and you seem to be unaware.

shh_Im_reading: Speak to more men about this. Do most men you know honestly believe that holding doors/giving compliments = sex? I mean if I haven't spoken to enough women, you haven't spoken to enough men. 

Rentalsoul: Women aren't idiots. They know the difference between people being actually nice and being creeps. And you saying I should talk to more men about women's experiences is fucking stupid.

shh_Im_reading: I never said women are idiots. I'm just trying to have a conversation and say that *some* people have their guard way too up because they see similar behavior online. You, on the other had, seem to want to just paint men as sex-crazed, savage pigs that see women as nothing but walking sex dolls.

You're putting yourself in an unassailable position by claiming that I don't know anything. That's fine, but I want to say the majority of men are actually polite and can hold a door for someone or give a compliment without expecting some physical thing in return.

TL;DR Most people are normal. This post was supposed to be a joke. Relax.

Rentalsoul: k

TryUsingScience: >  it makes it seem like more prevalent of an issue than it is. 

How prevalent do you think it is? Because I can guarantee you that every single woman you know has *at least* one story about a "nice guy" thinking she owes him sex. I have been out as a lesbian since I was 15 and I still have several of those stories. 

> But this doesn't mean that we need to assume that being approached is creepy/wrong by default. Issues like this as a whole make me worry because it feels like nobody is willing to trust their fellow citizens to just not commit crimes against them.

It's actually pretty simple. If someone approaches someone in an inappropriate way, it makes the approachee nervous because the approacher clearly doesn't understand proper social cues and/or boundaries and thus is more likely to be dangerous. If someone approaches someone in an appropriate way - say, at a bar instead of a gym - then the approachee is less likely to be nervous. In general, women don't trust men *who throw up red flags immediately*. 

ficcionella: You know sometimes I realize how totally outnumbered I am on this site & it bums me out to see people band together in celebration of shitting on women, so thank you for making me feel a little less alone.

RichGirlThrowaway_: Hitting on =/= shitting on. 

Being hit on, ultimately, is a compliment. It's annoying sometimes, it's unwanted sometimes, but you're not being insulted or attacked, you're being inconvenienced. The person getting rejected is the one who gets a much worse outcome out of that situation. I'm not saying go fuck whoever asks because you don't want to upset them, but I am saying you're overplaying how horrible it is to get hit on at the gym. It's mildly frustrating 99% of the time. 

ficcionella: I don’t think hitting on women = shitting on women.

I don’t feel complimented when I’m trailed around the gym with propositions to “get a real workout” on some stranger’s dick.

RichGirlThrowaway_: I mean you can pervert the argument and my position as much as you want, you'll always have popular opinion to back you up and justify your twistings of the argument in retrospect. 

ficcionella: I actually try to be pretty fair when I engage on here, so my intentions definitely aren’t to twist any arguments. I’m telling you I do not feel complimented when I’m hit on at the gym. I feel annoyed & wonder if this is another situation where I’m stalked & ogled until I have to leave. If you feel complimented, that’s great! 

RichGirlThrowaway_: The idea that "hit on" = "get a real work out on my dick" isn't fair at all, it's twisting the definition of what I said to put what I said in an extremely negative light.

ficcionella: I understand & that’s why I dialed it back.

Johnny_Walker_Red: > You seem to like speaking on behalf of all women quite a bit

Dude, women are constantly sharing a similar sentiment, and you guys just ignore it. She's just saying what every other woman has said on here a million times.

Women don't want you trying to hit on them at the gym. No matter how many times women say this, guys just can't seem to swallow it. They don't want to be cornered by some nasty swolebro who thinks he looks good and completely ignores all social cues. They don't want some pimply limp-dicked imp to attempt to court them when they're just trying to do their thing. It's really not hard to tell when a ~~girl~~ person isn't comfortable, or when they want you to go the fuck away, but somehow guys continue to impose their presence on these girls that just want them to fuckoff.

It's possible to meet girls at the gym, I've hooked up with plenty of girls I met at the gym, but I feel like it'll be more productive to just tell guys to avoid it entirely, because 99% of the time they make the girl uncomfortable. It's about respecting personal space, being conscious of when you're trapping a person in your presence. This stuff happens naturally, if you have to force it, it doesn't exist in the first place. Guys seem to have a hard time because they think "Well I'm super attracted to her, therefore she must feel similarly about me".

None: [deleted]

Johnny_Walker_Red: Ah, deflecting the point entirely because reading it would just be too hard huh?

Also, you obviously haven't checked my comment history if you think I'm a "limp-dicked imp". I've posted plenty of pics of my hard dick, or gifs of me fucking women, and it's 8.5" of wood. I've literally never had trouble getting it up.

Life isn't fair, some people are just born smarter, more handsome, more likable, etc. I'm the least insecure person on here, if anything I am on the verge of being narcissistic I have so much confidence.

Stop attempting to "flirt" with women at the gym. In fact, in your case, stop interacting with women in general, because I guarantee there are none that would accept you.

None: [deleted]

Johnny_Walker_Red: > you're the definition of a loser

I don't see how having an addiction makes one a loser. Also I haven't been on opiates in like 6 months. There are plenty of people with mental illnesses, it doesn't make them a loser.

Awkwardly attempting to flirt with women minding their own business at the gym? Ya, only 1) a loser, or 2) an incredibly naive, but good meaning boy, would ever do that. Mental health isn't exactly within one's control, nobody would choose to be depressed if they could. However it is a choice to completely ignore another person's personal space and/or bodily autonomy.

The thing is, despite being an addict, I still have no trouble getting women, because I'm not a dick. Being good looking helps too.

You’re speaking on a broad scale. **I** am speaking on the scale of me, myself, & I... *my personal* interactions on here carry with them a sense of feeling a bit isolated as a woman sometimes, especially when I voice my opinion.

I guess we can keep repeating ourselves if you want because I’m apparently going to DIE in this waiting room with nothing but time to kill- though you’re not going to make me feel any less outnumbered as time goes on, no matter how many front page articles you cite.

None: [deleted]

ficcionella: Nooo, silly goose! My personal statement about feeling outnumbered was never once applied to the general world. I never said other women feel outnumbered. 

wellinfactually: What a surreal exchange. Guy is like a walking contradiction of his own premises.

A woman saying she feels marginalized is like the bat signal for dudes who like to marginalize women, i guess.

ficcionella: Every once in a while I’ll have a super surreal interaction on Reddit & I have to see where the thread leads, I can’t help myself. And thank you! Enjoy your day, friend.

Whales96: Isn't he just shitting on a different gender? 

Joe_Jeep: No he's shitting on shit heads. If treating people nice is reserved for those you're trying to fuck you're not a good person.

Whales96: People use Nice Guy to talk about any male they don't like. No one actually believe in that kind of stuff in real life. Even in the post BERN is making up what the guy is thinking, and his history himself. 

alexmikli: Yeah the term has kind of lost it's meaning, but in this case it's specifically used for actual creeps.

BERNthisMuthaDown: The shitty moms are outnumbered by the ones like mine. Take heart, sis, that those troglodytes are just bluff and bluster. They are, by no means, the majority. 

'Man' is still a title with privileges AND responsibilities, and not just some accumulation of time alive, to a lot of us.

Fuck those weirdos, you go right and shine, O-Kaaaaaaaaaaaay?

tyrified: Holy shit! Share your opinion and they all come out of the woodwork! Do the other people who replied to you not see the irony in ganging up on you to tell you that you are wrong to feel outnumbered? Really?

princesskymmy: Explained to my high school students today. Women don't hate nice gestures just the expectations that come with them. 

Also get to explain to them other gems such as "dick tease" is not actually a thing (you can withdraw your consent at any time), no you don't deserve to get groped just because you went to a bar & cat calling is not a compliment. #RespectfulRelationships 

captainsavajo: >(you can withdraw your consent at any time)

I mean for a contract to standup legally, One has  to put the agreement in writing. To prove that we have consent, we have to get the agreement in writing. If a woman were to sign a contract to have sex with me, I do not feel that she could legally revoke consent at that time, provided the agreed upon terms in heretofore document were abided by. 

You can't breach any other contract because you changed your mind. Ideally, in a respectful relationship, the party revoking consent would be accommodated, but  I don't feel they'd have anymore legal basis to do so than a car buyer returning a car to the seller because they no longer consented to the transaction. 

princesskymmy: 1. We are talking about a person's body which is not property you are entitled to. 

2. This is not an episode of Black Mirror where people click "consent to all" on a dating app.

3.  Consent can also be explained here https://youtu.be/oQbei5JGiT8 


captainsavajo: 1. The subject matter doensn't matter. A contract to purchase a car or for sexual consent is still a contract. 

2. Ok. 

3. I woudn't click that link with your mouse. 

If you sign a contract you cannot just change your mind. That's the point of a contract. 

Johnny_Walker_Red: > If you sign a contract you cannot just change your mind.

Except you can. There are plenty of contracts that are illegal in the first place. Sex is one of them. You legally can't sign a contract that allows me to kill you and eat you, because the contract itself breaks the law. You cannot legally have a contract that allows potential rape to occur. If a person signed this contract, and changed their mind, having sex with them would be rape, and the courts would obviously agree with this.

Seriously, you say shit like

> You people live on another planet.

But you think that you can just write up any contract you like and that it would be legally binding. How dumb are you?

Really though, the legality of it doesn't matter, we're not talking about legality, we're talking about what's ethical. It would be supremely unethical to continue "having sex" (i.e. raping) a person after they decided they didn't want to. The fact that you somehow think you're entitled to that is seriously disturbing. You act like raping someone because you have a "contract" is only impolite, when it's really a serious moral (and legal) crime.

captainsavajo: Right, so there is no way to legally protect yourself against a rape claim. 

What a wonderful world! 

Johnny_Walker_Red: > Right, so there is no way to legally protect yourself against a rape claim.

There are plenty of ways. Very few people are ever convicted of rape falsely, in fact very few people are even charged with rape falsely.

Let's say you are falsely accused of rape, the courts won't just take their word for it, there is often evidence proving your innocence. And this is assuming that you're even falsely charged/accused in the first place, which is so incredibly rare.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAASs: Luckily the law doesn’t care how you feel about it


Consent is a continual thing that has to be held throughout the fucking, and you can’t sign that right away with a contract. It wouldn’t be legally binding 

captainsavajo: >. It wouldn’t be legally binding 

Lol ok. 

"Yes your honor, he has a contract signed by me consenting to sex but I changed my mind so it doesn't count!" 

You people live on another planet. In your mind, there is no way to prove consent, even by signing a written document on videocamera, because one of the parties could just change their mind later, negating the written document. 

It doesn't work like that. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAASs: It’s not about changing your mind later, it’s about changing your mind during the act. You can’t sign away that right, contracts don’t work that way

captainsavajo: You can't formalize your consent during the act. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAASs: You can’t legally continue to have sex with someone who no longer wants to have sex with you. 

None: [deleted]

princesskymmy: Edit: Though I understand the technicality you point out. 

Cat calls are actually just as creeper as hitting on girls at the gym. 

Obviously just in my experience,  I ask the students in my classes (I've run the program with roughly 300 students in the last 3 years). I find the 95% of the female students who experience it & the male students who have experienced it, don't view it as a compliment. Its the verbal version of groping. 

I think this explains it a bit better
https://youtu.be/peBddZQbWYk


averagejoegreen: Well I was wrong the definition of 'compliment' included politeness. 

PathologicalMonsters: > Women don't hate nice gestures just the expectations that come with them. 

Nice guys don't hate women, just the entitled ones that prey on their niceness.

> Also get to explain to them other gems such as "dick tease" is not actually a thing (you can withdraw your consent at any time)

You can withdraw consent ant any time, but that's unrelated to the dick tease thing. 


princesskymmy: These things at both from the Nice Guy TM playbook. 


Re: dick tease: Actually for teenagers it relates quite a lot. It's often a term used to convince someone to go further than comfortable or continue with a sexual act. It relates to "now I'm horny you are responsible for giving me the gratification". They actually do need to be told they can withdraw consent at anytime, yes it will be awkward, no they don't need to feel guilty or pressured about it. 

The very definition of "dick tease" is she flirted with me and now she should give me sex or now she didn't give me sex I assume/accuse she never intended to. The term is used in a derogatory manner. 

PathologicalMonsters: There's this lewd joke about the guy who takes his wife shopping, encourages her to pick out something expensive she wants, and then at the cashier's desk bids her put it back. 

Of course one can be dick- or pussy-teasing. Not as a way of being, but what one does in a situation can amount to that. That doesn't, again, mean that one can't withdraw consent, but to claim that there's one party (that is by coincidence always female now, when it used to be the man unable to control his animalistic urges) that is never responsible for what happens in an *interaction* is infantilising.

brain_on_drugs: 
>The very definition of "dick tease" is she flirted with me and now she should give me sex or now she didn't give me sex I assume/accuse she never intended to. The term is used in a derogatory manner. 

I can't say I've ever heard a guy say the phrase "dick tease" while thinking they are entitled to sex as a result of flirting with a girl. I've definitely heard it from guys who felt a girl was being overtly sexual and flirtatious with them but then find out it was because the woman was trying to manipulate them somehow. 

I realize by saying this I'm automatically perceived as a mgtow/redpill type neckbeard but isn't it kinda disingenuous to imply that women don't ever use sex (or the expectation of it) as a way to manipulate? 

princesskymmy: As a side note: later in the program we look at types of violence/abuse including emotional, social and financial. Which can be perpetrated by anyone. I'm not saying that women don't use manipulation but a common scenario in teenage interaction is pressure to continue whether refuse they are called "frigid" or a "dick tease" . 

We also discuss societal pressures on men, gender roles, sexualized nature of the media, porn is not the real world (yes, they actually need to be told the differences between that and actual relationships/expectations), domestic violence and consent. 

None: A guy walks into a bank with a ski mask and a shotgun. The bank teller calls the police and he is arrested. The man protests and say "I was just going duck hunting and it's cold outside". The office responds "That may be true but to a reasonable outside observer it looks like you are robbing the bank".  

It may be true that you are dressed in that skin tight low cut dress for yourself. However, to a reasonable person it looks like you enjoy the attention that it draws.

BERNthisMuthaDown: Also point out to them that women tend to act completely of their own agency, the same as we men do. Women have different needs, priorities, strengths, weaknesses, etc. so naturally, men and women generally speaking tend to do things differently, and for wholly different reasons that are only known to them, just like the rest of us.

We have to stop framing people we don't understand as these scary and mysterious "Others" that we'll never understand. 

A big part of the problem is this misconception that equality means pretending that we are all the same. That's patently absurd, people are as unique and singular as the stars in the sky, and their life choices tend to reflect that.

We need to emphasize everyone's right to self-determination, unless we want ours attacked at our opponents' convenience. I protect yours and you protect mine, that's been the American ideal for generations.

Somewhere along the way, we got selfish and self-righteous, and our pride has gone before the fall, just as the fables suggested, each time. We're each others' only hope of escaping a dystopian end to our upstart society. Stand together or die alone, slowly, losing a little liberty at a time.

Common consideration *goes a long way...*

None: That kinda breaks down when women don't really know what they want.  

Source: dated a bunch of girls.

charlie2158: That's because women, like men, aren't some monolithic entity that share a mind.

Believe it or not, people differ from one another. 

None: When you get more experience with women you will realize that although there is individual variation, there is also much commonality.

charlie2158: Not particularly, I'm not fucking someone new every other day but I'm not an incel either.

BERNthisMuthaDown: They know it when they see it. If they don't, you're not it.

None: I am not talking about me. I am talking about which restaurant to go to, should I quit my job, sally hates me omg. The attraction is the only thing you can consistently count on.

silinw: This is not a gendered thing though. The only reason men think women never know what they want is because they complain about it on the internet and validate eachothers experiences. Women are more likely to talk about this stuff to eachother in real life. 

BERNthisMuthaDown: And guys that have sex don't bitch about women on the internet. 

There's an incredible selection bias responsible for the misconception that they represent most men, when the truth is the inverse. 

princesskymmy: You make a good point.
 
After discussion the students concluded that it's nice to do nice things for people. But we don't necessarily need to do them because of someone's gender or because we expect something in return.





BERNthisMuthaDown: The only good reason to do nice things for other people is because doing that makes you happy, in and of itself.

Altruism isn't a sucker's bet, but rather the easiest and most reliable path to genuine happiness and peace of mind. If the Kids can learn that now, they can save themselves a lot of trouble in their 20s.

Pretty_Soldier: Quick interjection, from my perspective, the word  “equality” in no way tries to erase everyone’s individuality, it just means that nobody should be treated as lesser just because of who they are! :)

I_POTATO_PEOPLE: > just don’t hit on women at the gym. It’s really fucking uncomfortable for us

The reverse is true too. If you actually want me to spot you that's fine but I didn't come here to flirt.

TrueGrey: Where is the place in your schedule you DO go to to flirt?

In my city, people who go to bars are not who you want to date, and there's no designated flirt spot for normal people.  That's why most "aww, where did you two meet?" question is answered by somewhere they also didn't go to to flirt.

Gawdzilla: That is why I've learned not to ask a guy for help: they've assumed that I was flirting too many damned times.  It fucking sucks.

I_POTATO_PEOPLE: That's not what I said. Girls ask me for help from time to time, and that's fine. I'm an adult, I can tell the difference between asking for help and flirting.

Gawdzilla: And that's not what I said. 

I was expanding upon the idea that some girls DO flirt in the gym in addition to some guys assuming that a girl asking for help is flirting.  I didn't say you couldn't tell.  I was relating personal experience that some guys definitely cannot tell.

I'm saying that it's a both-ways problem.

It's also not just a gym problem.

JackWorthing: > just don’t hit on women at the gym. It’s really fucking uncomfortable for us. Why do we have to elaborate any further on this?

It wasn't until I started going to the gym with my wife to truly understand that women dress cute to go to the gym for themselves, not to attract sweaty gym bros. 

As for me, I assume every woman at the gym is pretty weary of getting hit on or leered at, so I just leave them all the hell alone as much as possible.

Zanford: Or, your wife also dresses cute at the gym for the bros...

Cn_mets: Women dress cute to attract men.  I don't know why this is all of a sudden a mystery to people. 

ishitinthemilk: No.

Cn_mets: ...yes.

EveViol3T: Women dress cute to feel good about themselves. We have mirrors, we don't need to use men for that. Not all about you.

Cn_mets: Lmao ok

EveViol3T: Yeah why listen to what women say about what they do and why? Listen to men who clearly are the experts in women's experiences and feelings. That will take you far. Lemme guess. Incel. 

Cn_mets: Haha. 

None: Of course girls would never dress cute to get attention...  

Maybe just not from you.

Striker654: > women dress cute to go to the gym for themselves

Also for other women

nutella19: No...

ZeroV2: Or maybe for men too? A woman could very well be wearing makeup to the gym to attract a man, just like any other reason

Nackles: Sure, but that's not an assumption you should make.  When in doubt, back off.

PM_ME_UR_FAV_QUOTE_: > Sure, but that's not an assumption you should make. When in doubt, back off.

no, but for some reason we should assume it's for every other reason BUT that.

Nackles: I think the real point is that you shouldn't make ANY assumption.  

Gawdzilla: Does it matter? The point is that they're not necessarily doing it for men.  The point is that it is wrong to assume that they're wearing cute gym clothes just to attract men's attention.

Crabaooke: I avoid women because I'm embarrassed of my weak gains 

JackWorthing: I feel that too

PM-Me-ur-Self-Esteem: i would never be one of tjose girls who would do my hair and make up before going to the gym (cuz what's the point in that? ) but I gotta say it TOTALLY boosts morale to dress cute so when you're looking at your sweaty fat fuck self in the mirror you can be like "alright! I look good!"

I've gone to the gym in just my loose sweats and a crappy t shirt and it's way harder to do the routines while seeing how icky I  (presumably feel) I look. Looking good helps you feel good!

None: Thank God I am a dude.

catrain: Last night I couldn't find my cute workout pants. My boyfriend said to just throw on some basketball shorts and just go. He didn't understand that I had to have my pants. My workout isn't going to be nearly as productive if I don't feel good about myself when doing it.

SeizeTheDayMFer: Look good, feel good. Feel good, play good. So true. 

raanne: > i would never be one of tjose girls who would do my hair and make up before going to the gym

Also, many women go to the gym after work or something where they are already wearing makeup. Why go through the effort of removing it if you are just going to take a shower after working out? 

PM-Me-ur-Self-Esteem: oh for sure! Yeah no point in taking it off. I guess I'm thinking of when id go to my college gym and I knew a lot of the girls were putting on it before hand. Regular public gym you never know, though.

swr3212: That's just college. Everyone is trying to fuck everyone everywhere all the time. 

Medi-Saiyan: I agree. Look good, feel good. Also it's the gym... the motto is basically "fuck what other people think, I'm better than I was yesterday"  
  
But also, I agree women should be allowed to exist in public spaces without constant attention/harassment. 

TemporaryDonut: >fuck what other people think, I'm better than I was yesterday

I love you 

MattPH1218: > As for me, I assume every woman at the gym is pretty weary of getting hit on or leered at, so I just leave them all the hell alone as much as possible.

Maybe it's just me, but I don't want to talk to anybody at the gym. I'm sweaty, disgusting, and trying to get this shit done so I can go watch Netflix on the couch with my dog. You are cutting into my Netflix time with the dog by striking up a conversation.

summonsays: Maybe it's those people who go to the gym and sit on the equipment or stand on the treadmill. Maybe people figure if they aren't working out they're hanging out for other reasons?

I don't know though, I wouldn't go to the gym to pick up women anyway. Mostly bevause I'm married. Failing that, I'm a little lazy and fear they'd make me go everyday lol.

Goop1995: Seriously who are all these weirdos wanting to talk to people at the gym? Last thing I want to do is converse with someone, Im just trying to listen to my music. 

FearHold: It is possible to socialize anywhere including a public/member only gym...can you please stop acting like it's a foreign concept.

Goop1995: I’m okay with people socializing at the gym. I just think it’s a weird place to do so. I don’t know many people who go to the gym expecting to talk to anyone. 

ThatRaggedyMan: In college, the gym on weekends becomes extra clogged because the sorority sisters and fraternity brothers are basically there to scope out who they're going to talk to at whichever party they'll be at.

It's fairly obvious who's there for what since the girls will be heavily made up, and the guys will be doing extra reps while holding their weights on whichever side the girl they're chatting up happens to be on.

CarsAndGuns: Yeah I know, but why would you try to talk to someone with headphones in. They clearly don't want to talk. Last Monday I was in the gym locker room/ bathroom washing my hands after working out and an old naked guy next to me shaving his face decided to try to talk to me about the Superbowl. Like why would he think I would want to talk to him. 

Brendanm132: I dunno if I'd call them weirdos. To a lot of people the gym isn't a chore, and it's not something you have to do so you can feel less guilty when you watch Netflix the rest of the night. It's legitimately a hobby/lifestyle/thing they enjoy doing. And when you're in that mindset, just like with any other hobby, you might socialize with people who feel the same way and form some friendships and connections.

Goop1995: Yeah you’re right. The way I look at it is a 1-2 hr period where I’m alone to let loose without worrying about talking to anyone. I can see why others would feel differently tho. 

Its_Pine: HA! Jokes on you, I hit on other men at the gym! 

But seriously, guys here love it when other guys compliment them or ask them for advice, so it goes great. 

Ikea_Man: guys in general like compliments because we never get compliments

onlyonebread: I see this comment all the time but it doesn't jive with my experience at all. Do you not have people compliment you when you get a new haircut or a new outfit or something? I've had total strangers tell me that my hair was amazing or that I had cute eyes. Someone even said that I had an amazing butt which was surprising to say the least.



Zibini: Lol yeah you're way out of touch with the average experience, not gonna lie. 

I'd bet my life that about 10% or more of guys go through their ENTIRE lives without being complimented by a random person. 

Most people get a handful of compliments, it's only the top 10% of guys that get complimented regularly. You have to be tippy top. 

onlyonebread: Well that's just sad

Ikea_Man: lol like the other guy said, you're likely an attractive guy.

i'm not saying I NEVER get compliments. i've gotten some on my beard, or a new shirt. even gotten a butt one a few times. 

but in general, the culture is that women get complimented constantly on their appearance, where guys really have to go after it (or just be hot)

GwynnJ: You can have the compliments. Most of us women don’t want or need random guys commenting on our appearance.

Zibini: This is the most annoying comment ever. Women are so out of touch with how desperate the average woman actually is for validation lmao. 

Women are wayyyy more likely to be attention seekers than men are, because men know we'll just look bad and get negative attention. Women can show their fat bodies and girls will validate the shit out of them and thirsty men will still proposition them. 

You're completely out of touch with reality, this is compliment privilege. 

GwynnJ: Women are out of touch about the thoughts and feelings of women? That makes sense...

I forgot that, as a woman, my opinions and personal experiences (and those of my female friends and family) are invalid because some guy on the internet says so. I AM an average woman, but clearly you know more about women than women do.

Also, if you have a problem with men not validating other men, be part of the solution instead of bitching about “attention seeking” women.

Zibini: Just because you're a woman does not mean you're smart. You seem pretty dumb, actually. Stop hiding behind the "as a whooomannn" card, you fucking loser lol. Nobody cares that you have tits, it doesn't make you more enlightened. 

Clearly I do know more than you, but that's not surprising since your primary argument is just "REEE I have a vagina so my opinions are more valuable!" I get compliments from men. It's women who almost never compliment men. 

Just gonna repeat what I said, you're out of touch. Also you're an idiot. Don't make arguments from authority, it's literally the lowest and most base form of arguments. It's pathetic.

EvidentlyTrue: Alternatively, he might have thought you were hitting on him, but he didn't think you were attractive enough, so he just played it off.

Now that you ask, yes, I really am this fun at parties.

N413: I was at new years and there was a hot tub, there's this girl who got super flirty after a few drinks/sitting on my lap/ rubbing leg etc.Everyone had met before to some extent so everyone knew each other to some degree, no randos. But it became super obvious that after awhile she got way too drunk and couldn't really stand, so I sat her down on the couch, made sure she was okay and left. One of her friends then starts informing me quite forcefully that her friend is going.to.bed. with strong undertones of back the fuck off. Anyway, I had no intentions of doing anything but the aftermath was such that my closer friends started yelling at her for assuming I would've taken advantage of the drunken one and I was totally on the side of the girl giving me shit-- she was just looking out for her girl and didn't know me that well.

lifepsycho123: If all humans were vegetarian/vegan, then the total plant population would decline causing more carbon oxides in the environment. Meat eaters are literally keeping the planet’s atmosphere balanced by not being vegan. Also, chickens have no significant role in the ecosystem which makes it easier to cook them without feeling bad or guilty 

shadowbannedscrub1: That'd only be true if we got our meat from hunting.  If we eat less farm animals, then we'd just breed less farm animals, therefore decreasing the total amount of plants eaten.

Kenny1239: Fun fact : Eating animals kills more plants than a vegan / vegetarian diet.

We'd grow more plants in all the space that was taken up by cattle farming and slaughterhouses

Motherfucker what do you think " environmental sustainability reasons " means?

vgnEngineer: Why the name calling? Also, actions that follow from a motive of "environmental sustainability" gives you only a subset or a set that intersects with veganism partially. Not everything regarding veganism would be included if you do it for the environment.

Dr_Smoothrod_PhD: r/gatekeeping

Almost935: Downvoted for being annoying 

Jakeb19: > Downvotes because why? lmao

Because you're being self righteous, like you own the term vegan because you picked the diet (or philosophy in your mind) for the "right" reasons. Like if someone chooses it for health or environmental reasons like this guy, he's not a "real vegan" (whatever that's supposed to mean)

Anyway point is, you shouldn't really give a shit if he buys into the philosophy of rejecting"the commodity status of animals " or not. He's a vegan, should be happy about that instead of playing diet police. Trying to make people feel less, that's counterproductive. You're basically telling him to eat meat and I'm sure that goes against the so called "Vegan Philosophy" bullshit lol 

None: [deleted]

Jakeb19: Well the definitions of words change and I'm sorry to break the news to you but vegan now refers to people who abstain from any animal byproducts. You're going to have to come up with a new term for your philosophy, I know it's unfair and the burden shouldn't be on you but its kind of your guys fault for not being clear enough.

 I'm sorry your word was hijacked but vegans who adhere to the "moral stance" the "philosophy" are the only ones arguing about the definition of the term so like I said, find a new term lol

None: [deleted]

Jakeb19: And unfortunately people like me are the majority. We don't care if we're missing using the word vegan because its the best word to describe people who adhere to the diet. 

Like I said in my other comment, you don't need to come up with a new term, pretty sure people who don't adhere to the same philosophy are perfectly happy sharing the term. Unfortunately though, you seem to have a problem with people who adhere to diet but no the philosophy referring to themselves as "vegans" so my advice to you is come up with a new term, don't need to be stubborn lol 

None: [deleted]

-jFk-: Can you justify your claim of that being the only viable definition? Because I'm pretty sure people who abstain from animal products are also vegans.

elzibet: Vegan society coined the term, vegan society states veganism is about the animals. 

So yeah... they’re correct it’s about the animals 

Jakeb19: I'm not trying to convince, just giving friendly advice that would alleviate your butthurtness lol

Anyway, agree to disagree, have a nice day my plant based friend

elzibet: Vegan society coined the term, vegan society states veganism is about the animals. 

So yeah... they’re correct it’s about the animals. 

349days: Veganism isn't just a diet thing, it's about abstaining from any animal products. A plant based diet is a healthy diet but simply going plant based isn't the same as going vegan. They are two different things, the person you were responding to was right about that.

SeinfeldFan9: I know that and I do appreciate you reminding me and many others, as well as informing many. I guess you could say I eat a plant based diet, but I also abstain from all animal products. I'm not necessarily doing it for the animals, but I do think the lives they live in factory farming and being murdered for the mouth pleasure of humans is wrong 

None: [deleted]

elzibet: Well said!

SeinfeldFan9: That's what I thought 👍

elzibet: Hey man, I appreciate that. My husband is more plant based too but avoids the same stuff I do. Thanks for helping, friend <3

SeinfeldFan9: I don't understand the down voting frenzy in this thread. Crazy how much some people care about what other people eat. What foods do you avoid and what's your reasoning? Just out of curiosity.

elzibet: Yeah... the downvotes are usually because people don’t like hearing you don’t eat animals. Because most think you’re immediately judging them. But I have no right to judge others, hell I used to work in a factory farm. If anyone should be judged it’s me. 

To the best of my knowledge I no longer eat any animal products and avoid using or wearing anything. Last June I made the realization that if I don’t need to eat animals for survival then I’m simply doing it for pleasure. 

After that realization I just couldn’t justify pleasure as a reason to keep supporting the exploitation and killing.

Cornscope: You also probably have only been veggie/vegan for a couple of years.

elzibet: That means nothing, the point is, there is nothing you need from animals. B12 doesn't come from animals it comes from a bacteria. The only way you become deficient is if you're not getting the nutrients you need. 

None: [deleted]

elzibet: Okay, it seems like you have a lot of misunderstanding about a plant-based diet, and where things actually come from.

Lets start with where b12 comes from. 

 B12 is made by anaerobic microorganisms (ie. bacteria that do not require oxygen to live). This is something that bacteria *can* develop inside the intestinal tracts of many animals humans consume. **But it is not the animals themselves that make the b12**. The intestines are simply a dark enough place that allow the bacteria to form. Everyone takes a b12 supplement in one way or another, over [90% of b12 supplements go to livestock](http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/carnivores-need-vitamin-b12-supplements/2013/10/30#sthash.RerFgkfc.dpuf) due to the clean environments our societies live in and they can no longer get it naturally. 

These are all things I had no idea about before switching, so I can totally understand your thinking. 

> You cannot raise a child from birth as a vegan without having to dose them with 20 supplement pills a day, not good for a developing body or liver.

Can I see a source for this claim? Because you might need to inform these leading experts on the matter as to why it's not healthy.

>or the fact that hundreds of millions, even billions of people on earth currently, could never afford to have the luxury of not eating meat.

Ohh... no... eating meat is a luxury. Why do you think it's subsidized so heavily? Vegan friendly products like rice, beans, and lentils are some of the cheapest things in the grocery store.

qscmplx: Shit! Are those are the only foods that are considered vegan?! I've been doing it all wrong. 

FYI, B12 is also produced by bacteria in the human gut, it's too far down for absorption. But it's in your own shit.

elzibet: B12 is from a bacteria, animal intestines is not the only place it comes from. It’s mainly found in soil. 

Okay, if you’re not gonna cite sources and not read about where b12 comes from then there is no point in continuing.

ScottPrombo: Also, thanks for talking about veganism respectfully. It can be a pretty hot-button issue, so it's nice to have straighforward, well thought-out, and courteous conversations like this.

ScottPrombo: Sure, true veganism might not be totally natural because of B12, but humans have never been a species to be constrained by nature, as long as the goal is within reason. And with regards to supplements, it's not many supplements. The multivitamin pill I take daily more than covers my needs.

And with regards to it only being "healthier" because of the quality of the meat... I think chalking it up to being mostly a moral issue is quite disingenuous (at least in America, where I am) because processed meats are so deeply integrated into daily life. Here's the [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17518696) discussed in the video, which pretty clearly spells out that following a vegan diet is a great way to be statistically predisposed to settle on a lower BMI than the average meat-eating person. Is it the only way to lower your BMI? Certainly not, but it is a way. Further, I'm not sure how difficult it'd be to totally avoid processed meats in America, but I do know that once you make the switch to veganism, things like fast food (so not just processed meat, but also the fries/soda that come along with it) lose their relevance/appeal entirely, which may factor into that study's disparity between meat-eaters and vegans. Plus, it's just kinda neat to be part of the movement and to make deliberate lifestyle choices.

But alas, it does currently require a fair amount of effort to make the switch to a vegan lifestyle. Even then, there simply aren't as many options in restaurants for vegans. The vegan movement is quickly gaining recognition and market share though, so over time it'll become easier and easier to make the switch.

What's honestly pathetic is how often you vegans feel the need to justify your reasoning for being vegan on irrelevant threads just because they have the word vegan in them. On top of that, you can't even all be on the same page. You've got one justifying their choices (that nobody cares about) while another one is informing the other they're not a fucking vegan (which also nobody cares about).

vdB65: Plants aren't sentient.

Wacko_Jack: They still live like the rest of us. It's not easy being a plant.

vdB65: Not capable of feeling pain. Big difference

Wacko_Jack: Fish don't feel pain. Is it okay to eat them?

vdB65: How do you know they don't feel pain?

hellofafuckingday: I think my irrational hatred of vegans is the reason it took me a second to get this joke.

I clicked to comment before I even finished reading just because I hate vegans so much.

edit: Thank you vegans for pointing out the error of my ways. You are right, you are so much more knowledgeable and caring than everyone else. Good for you.

hi_im_horse: k

stoolpigeon87: That's cool. 

ahhhhhhhhhyelling: NOTHING can stop me from crunching on vegetals bitch

sexylurkyalt: Well, I guess at least you acknowledge it's irrational? Not sure why you're getting so much hate for recognizing your own error.

hellofafuckingday: Because vegans are the worst people on earth?

Should be obvious lol.

sexylurkyalt: Welp, I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt. My bad.

oj-did-it: I'm not a vegan, but after this comment I know they aren't the worst people on earth.

LPlantarum: Why would you hate a small set of people who care about helping to protect animals from suffering and help save humanity from pollution, deforestation, unnecessary waste, antibiotic resistance and c02 emissions?

You know what... If you hate anyone at all for being vegan you hate anyone who is trying to help save others and the world.

So if that's how you feel then you're pure evil pretty much, maybe go see a psych? You sound like you need help hahaha

hellofafuckingday: Hahaha omg.

This is exactly what I mean.

I don’t care what you guys do, like why would I care if you eat meat or not?

I hate you because you are obnoxious and say stuff like that haha.

capisill88: You are sofa king we Todd Ed 

None: [deleted]

hellofafuckingday: Yes.

So much.

tofusandwichinspace: having said that, well done for the effort and general care in the issue

tofusandwichinspace: 95% or so of soy in the world is fed to farmed animals (soy proteins makes them grow faster instead of their natural grass diet, just so meat corporations can make more money). 
The 1.2 vegans you know are not the ones destroying south america.

LPlantarum: Well why did you write the first obnoxious comment in this post then? Haha

You hate yourself technically if you don't like random people asserting their opinions online?

You literally just have done that

hellofafuckingday: lol I don't give a shit that you HAVE an opinion.

It was the fact that your opinion was that you are the savior of humanity because your like "Do you use cream in your mashed potatoes?"

LPlantarum: I'm just pointing out a new perspective with facts to try and give you some information about the people who you "Hate" and why they are contributing to helping sustain the long term health of the world by reducing their environmental impacts.



hellofafuckingday: >If you hate anyone at all for being vegan you hate anyone who is trying to help save others and the world.

The implication here is that only vegans try to help others or make the world a better place.

You just called that a fact.

This is why people hate vegans. 

I_Argue_Pointlessly: I would love to know how you got that implication from what you quoted. I have never heard even a single vegan say that they are the *only* ones trying to make the world a better place.

It seems like you have latched onto Vegans as something to hate, and will twist anything into a justification for your hatred. You said yourself that your hatred is irrational, and I think you were right on the money.

hellofafuckingday: >If you hate anyone at all for being vegan you hate anyone who is trying to help save others and the world.

If you have a 7th grade reading level or higher you should be able to break this down...

>If you hate anyone at all for being vegan...

Okay so lets go with YES which is what I said... So we have an affirmative response here...

>you hate anyone who is trying to help save others and the world.

So, because I hate vegans I hate ANYONE who is trying to save others and the world.

the implication then is that only vegans try to help save others and the world. Because I don't hate non-vegans who want to help others.

English motherfucker, do you speak it?

USARSUPTHAI69: > English motherfucker, do you speak it?

I find it very amusing when barely literate prepubescent basement dwellers criticize others for their English.

>Hahaha omg


>lol I don't give a flying fuck

>you are the savior of humanity because your like


>say stuff like that haha.

>the implication then is that only vegans try to help save others and the world.

>I'm not gonna read that lol.

>hahhahaha.

Your expository style is that of a very angry juvenile posting to her Facebook account. I have no problem with that except that you seem to feel it necessary to criticize others. Glass houses you know! To break it down for you, - omg u dum hahahaha (or is that too many haha's).

hellofafuckingday: Who gives a fuck about style as long a you convey the correct information lol.

The guy claims vegans are the only good people... On accident apparently.

You know like at least like bro the way I says things makes the sense you know what I mean brah? Despite the fact I don't put a lot of effort into my expository style ya kna'whaimean

USARSUPTHAI69: > Who gives a fuck about style

Any thinking reasoning adult that wants to make a clear, logical and convincing argument. Clearly that's not you.

hellofafuckingday: Duh.

I'm here to piss off vegans, and I was wildly successful at it.

USARSUPTHAI69: > Duh.

This succinctly sums up everything that you've posted thus far.

ahhhhhhhhhyelling: hahaha epic trole

LPlantarum: I did not say that helping save the world is exclusive to vegans.

I actually believe that there are probably far more people trying to make the world a better place than there are vegan people.

Get over yourself man all I did is question why you hate vegans because they are trying to help do nice things?

Then you didn't know what the nice things were, so I told you some positive facts about side effects of veganism and then you got angry and now you're trying to depict me as a vegan supremacist? Just because I laid info on the table?

Calm down internet stranger




hellofafuckingday: lol I don't give a flying fuck what people eat lol.

I hate vegans because they are like you. Obnoxious, self-righteous, etc. 

LPlantarum: It's not about what you eat. It's about the side effects of what you eat. You have to realise at some point that vegans might seem annoying if they push info to the public alot about what we should eat but it is purely because they care about helping to reduce societies carbon footprint, pollution, waste and suffering in general. 

Also you seem to be generalizing a tonne about vegans like all vegans are obnoxious and self righteous? You're discriminating against veganism in general and that is a flawed way to analyse a type of person in my opinion.

It would be like if I said "I hate all black people because they are all obnoxious and self righteous." You shouldn't make broad overarching statements about a single demographic it's incredibly narrow minded.

It's not about pushing some agenda that vegans are an alien super race who are the greatest beings and morally superior to any other human that even considers eating animal products. It's about doing positive things.

I'm here spamming out a reddit battle with you purely because I want more people to realise how we can come together and take action to do something that will have massive positive effects for everyone's future, including yours by the way.

hellofafuckingday: I'm not gonna read that lol.

But yeah please keep explaining how you aren't obnoxious and self-righteous... You just care more.

hahhahaha. I did read the first two sentences. Good God man. 

LPlantarum: Everyone else who has been following along will have seen this and read it and I will have helped my cause. I'm pretty sure you read the whole thing too, good luck with your sad life

SmingleDink: Holy shit dude teach me how to be this patient with imbeciles

bot105: I understand the 'protect from suffering' angle, but i cant think of any way bieng vegan will 'save humanity'. Can you elaberate?

lnfinity: The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

The World Bank estimates that [91% of the land deforested in the Amazon since 1970 has been cleared for grazing](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/02/000090341_20040202130625/Rendered/PDF/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf). Raising cattle for food requires far more land than growing plant-based foods directly for consumption. It also is a substantial contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, [a bigger share than all of transportation according to the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock%27s_Long_Shadow). However, those aren't the only areas of serious concern. The UN has also stated:

>The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

>Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

WikiTextBot: **Livestock's Long Shadow**

Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options is a United Nations report, released by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on 29 November 2006, that "aims to assess the full impact of the livestock sector on environmental problems, along with potential technical and policy approaches to mitigation".

antimonysb: Livestock animals produce a lot of green house gases and consume a lot of water. Cows especially produce a ton of methane. So some people go vegan with the intention of having a smaller impact on the environment. 

jfit003: Shouldn’t you want to kill the cows then?

None: [deleted]

jfit003: You could make the same argument for vegetables and fruits. They use abundant amounts of water, are sprayed with chemicals and travel thousands of miles by gas guzzling diesel trucks. If your argument is to not eat meat to save the environment then you should stop using your AC, powering your house, gassing up your vehicle and everything else that strains the environment. You can’t make the argument for on and ignore the others 

None: [deleted]

jfit003: Wow language. So much for having a mature argument with another human. If you can’t prove your point without insulting someone that you my friend are the sad one. Harm? Do you shed a tear when a lion eats a zebra? This is nature. Animals will always suffer so another can survive. If you think that isn’t the case then you don’t understand the circle of life. Maybe you should go watch the lion king a few times. Also, don’t try to insult another humans intelligence just to try to make yourself look better. That’s just petty. I won’t pretend to know you so don’t pretend to know me. 

maoejo: Well, we raise them and kill them to eat them. If we didn't eat them, they'd die off.

RoNiN_0001: So you love animals.... but you want them to die?

Edit: It was a joke, not a steak, don't try to get insulted by it.

Djov: There's a difference in dying naturally and in mass slaughterhouses that many currently die in.

RoNiN_0001: I know you people don't get to hang around with others very often, but that's what we call a "joke"

Djov: I bet lol

ahhhhhhhhhyelling: it really reads like you meant it in earnest AKA bad delivery todd

LPlantarum: Well I gave a few examples in the previous comment a few are, being vegan reduces deforestation (alot of forests are cleared to grow crops to feed animals). It also reduces the use of vast amounts of water and other resources required for feeding animals. One pound of beef requires more than 2400 gallons of water to produce it. 

Obviously cows and tonnes of other animals fart and eat alot, and us humans happen to eat ALOOOOTTT of them (over 56 billion farm animals a year) so this combined with shipping livestock and their food all over the world constantly produces alot of gasses that are awful for our ozone. This is speeding up climate change and contributes more than people realise.

Antibiotic resistance is another way that eating meat is seen as bad for humans in general. The animals we eat are often pumped up on antibiotics to stop them from getting sick so that if someone down at the pub eats a nice steak than he/she can be more sure they won't end up with E.coli or some other horrible bacteria inside them. 



veggiter: I think it's usually cognitive dissonance. 

None: [deleted]

None: [deleted]

tofusandwichinspace: That's sadly true though, but it's just a defensive attitude generated by the sick society we live in. It takes a lot of effort and mental strength to do it, especially in rural areas or small towns. It does go away after a few years of veganism, once it becomes a comfortable routine.

None: [deleted]

tofusandwichinspace: haha, thanks. Having a tofu sandwich in space one day would be the only way to beat the pleasurable experience that is what having one on earth is! What a delight it's gonna be when we can finally get there. 

What I meant is that it's OK if vegan individuals can sometime be or look slightly over the top. It's also almost OK for people to be a bit weirded out by it as they have been soaking in a society that told then animal products where fantastic. 
It's not easy for everyone to do the vegan transition and some people take things very seriously. You're absolutely right, it is far easier for usual people to condemn vegans rather than confront or just even question and fully research the impact of their own lifestyle.

Maybe I just think that as a result of my own experience. It is really annoying when people ask you dumb questions ALL THE TIME, and I think it's fair for some to get in the mood you mentioned. It's much better than keeping on following the status quo, "just because".
Maybe I'm out of reality and new vegans these days are mostly chilled out about it and it is indeed, as you mentioned, just idiots carrying these stereotypes, following the most ridiculous examples the media love to carry.

DrewSharpvsTodd: No anger here, I've come to a place of acceptance. I think we all need to accept that fact that this year's Iteration of our beloved Sox, are at best a middle of the division team. They will finish with a winning record, of that I have little doubt. However they really don't have a shot at the playoffs this year. But should we really be surprised? Did we not have our expectations set way to high coming off a year where the Sox finished in first place? After Mookie Betts MVP-caliber season, and the emergence of future talents like Andrew Benitendi, were we forced to chase the dream once again?
Honestly, I truly feel they will end up in the middle of the pack behind the ( gulp) Yankees, and Tampa Bay.

mysteryodour: Not a dumb question at all. Its less the aspect of ownership and more the focus on responsibility and compassion for all living things. I’m a bit toasted after work, so here’s a link to a beautiful book that encompasses these philosophies through the eyes of a cat: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15805413-the-dalai-lama-s-cat 

crazymunch: As much as I remember if you're say a monk in a Buddhist temple you can't own a dog per se, but a lot of temples do care for local stray dogs and put out food for them

Spacequeenmashi: I never think of caring for and having a furry family member as “owning” them. Which is why i understand why they care for local strays and treat them as their own.

Buddhist ideaology is that every single life is precious, and no one is above anyone. Im not buddhist myself but i absolutely understand where theyre coming from.

KingofNorthKorea: Highways are useful if done right. T Hey can be used to isolate a high density city center from surrounding suburbs. unfortunately, they are just smashed directly through the guts of towns and little planning is made around them.

Look at each picture, there is definitely an isolated area within the Highway loops which can be seen. if development was focused on this area they can be turned into high density city centers, instead, we pretend like the highway is not cutting neighborhoods in half and just let it run.

crackanape: > T Hey can be used to isolate a high density city center from surrounding suburbs. 

What is good about that?

KingofNorthKorea: Isolating the city center encourages higher density development. This can help keep neighborhoods low density and prevent greater sprawl. Neighborhoods can be clustered into "village" formations and create small communities which do not bleed into other communities and these villages can be close by commuter neighborhoods to the city. Increasing both neighborhood and city density to increase green space between the neighborhoods and decrease the need for continual sprawl.

Lord_Trajan: >Isolating the city center encourages higher density development.

You mean in the tiny little core? Sure, but at the cost that the much, much, much larger area outside the ring will have LOWER density and will be basically completely inaccessible without a car.

>Neighborhoods can be clustered into "village" formations and create small communities which do not bleed into other communities and these villages can be close by commuter neighborhoods to the city. Increasing both neighborhood and city density to increase green space between the neighborhoods and decrease the need for continual sprawl.

Now besides the fact that a city itself can be a village or neighborhood, why the hell wouldn't we just do that with parks or walls of buildings?

KingofNorthKorea: You have an odd description of "Tiny core". additionally Density is determined by zoning, things could be overzoned with approval of the state to reverse or promote low density at will.

Lord_Trajan: >You have an odd description of "Tiny core".

How is that odd? It's a perfect description? LA is a textbook example of what you propose. The core is 12 square kilometres. The Greater LA area? 90 thousand square kilometres.

>additionally Density is determined by zoning

*facepalm* then why do you think we need freeways to as you say "keep neighborhoods low density and prevent greater sprawl." we can do the same thing with zoning.

FuckRyanSeacrest: Fight me irl

alexfrancisburchard: My neighborhood has 113,000/sqmi at night (probably 200,000-300,000/sqmi by day), and no crazy people, I've seen one person strung out on drugs in 3 years, few panhandlers, and the ones we do have aren't aggressive, The subway sparkles, the busses are clean and fast, and driving is an absolutely miserable experience, despite plenty of overly wide roads. For people who make not having a car work, quality of life is great. Like me, I walk to everything, my quality life is a million times better than when I used to drive to school on a reverse commute with no congestion in Suburban Seattle. 

Cars stop working when you have a proper city, they just don't efficiently handle large numbers of people. And cities don't have to be full of diseased drugged out, etc. folks. If you take care of your city, and of the people in it, cities can sparkle, Americans are too cheap for that though, so alas.

ItWasTheMiddleOne: > without taking the disease-ridden subways where the vagabonds panhandle, or buses where someone with some sort of disease stares at you and grunts occasionally

Jesus dude, just say "the wretched peasant-folk." It's more concise and we know what you're trying to say either way.

JobDestroyer: Really? You prefer life with a bunch of pan-handlers that smell like body-odor and alcohol? That's your idea of comfort? Stop pretending like I'm crazy for simply being honest about the fact that homeless people are a put-off. I don't mind them standing on the side of the highway with a sign, I don't want to talk to them, though. You're the same way, you're just pretending you aren't. 

Besides, peasants work for a living, panhandlers just make messes of garbage cans and lie about how they were screwed in Katrina. 

crackanape: > Really? You prefer life with a bunch of pan-handlers that smell like body-odor and alcohol?

That is not a necessary component of city living. I see one or two panhandlers a week tops, and I live in a major city, within a few minutes walking distance of the center. 

gsfgf: > You prefer life with a bunch of pan-handlers that smell like body-odor and alcohol?

Yes, I'd rather deal with homeless people, who are a minor annoyance at worst, than dealing with the fucking suburbs.  

DYMAXIONman: I think the government should work to end homelessness; currently suburbs just ship their homeless off to the nearest city. 

JobDestroyer: Last time they did that we got a housing bubble and a massive recession. 

Instead of thinking the *government* should do something, why not take personal responsibility for it yourself and do it on your own with other volunteers? It's not charity to have the government do something, and there's nothing to be proud of in saying "Someone else who is not me should take care of X issue!" There is pride, however, in taking it as a personal responsibility and doing it yourself. 

wpm: >Personal responsibility

The only reason you can fucking afford your *uhmazing* house 40 miles from where you work and your *uhmazing* car you sit in for hours a day is because the government probably subsidized the mortgage that built the house in the first place, subsidizes the infrastructure necessary to build it so far away from anything, subsidizes the costs of the roads you use every day, fights fucking wars for the fuel you suck up, and subsidizes the oil companies that sell it to you. 

You use the most subsidized form of transportation in the country, and factored into that cost are almost none of the negative externalities you force onto others. 

You're a hypocrite.

DYMAXIONman: TIL Homeless people caused the 2008 recession

JobDestroyer: The housing bubble did, it's unfair to blame homeless people because they didn't write the legislation that caused it. Clinton's basic idea was that it was unfathomable that some Americans were incapable of affording their own home, so he instituted certain reforms to change that. The biggest was that he insured mortgages. 

When you insure mortgages, the idea is that banks will feel more comfortable giving out mortgages, as if the mortgage goes south, it's no biggie, the government can bail them out. As a result, the banks gave away tons of mortgages to tons of people who were *totally* not the type who could afford those mortgages. As a result, property prices went through the roof. People were using their homes as giant piggy-banks, essentially, because they would put a ton of money into making sure that their property values would go up. Then people would build a bunch of homes because it was easy to sell them. Then the housing bubble collapsed, the prices of homes dropped like a brick, and a ton of banks, incapable of recouping their losses due to people simply not having the money to pay for the mortgages that the banks should have known they couldn't afford, hit up the government to bail them out as they had been promised. 

A ton of banks got bought up by bigger banks, the fed started pumping out new money (thus inflating the currency) in their quantitative easing programs, and over 10 percent of Americans were unemployed.

Trust me, it'd be better if you took personal responsibility and decided to help out homeless people yourself. Take a look at one of the many charitable organizations out there that help those with low incomes get homes without having to take out mortgages, and pick up a hammer.

Megaman03: > Trust me, it'd be better if you took personal responsibility

Systemic problems can't be solved with individual solutions. 



SmellGestapo: I'd bet $80 billion dollars you avail yourself of the mortgage interest tax deduction, complain when you have to pay for parking, and have issued a public comment in favor of higher parking requirements. But you have never considered yourself a welfare queen. 

JobDestroyer: You'd lose that bet because I haven't done any of that. You're definitely living in a bubble. 

SmellGestapo: I don't believe you. 

Butter_Meister: He's a libertarian. They're immune to reason.

remy_porter: Maybe cities just aren't for you. You should live in the country. Waaaaaay out in the country. Hundreds of miles away from everything, and especially everyone. You'll make us all happier. I mean, *you'll* be much happier.

Have you ever actually lived in a city? It sounds like you haven't. 

JobDestroyer: I lived in Brooklyn and downtown Rochester. Both places are cancer, though Rochacha was the better of the two. I currently live in a city that was developed *after* the car was invented, and we have a nice set of one-ways in the middle of downtown (the historic district) and everything else is easy to park on. The best thing about Rochester is that it has massive suburbs that are easily accessed via car, like Henrietta where I used to do all my shopping after I moved to Scottsville. If I needed anything, I could *drive* to the center of town, and leave at the end of the day. 

not possible in Brooklyn, Brooklyn is made for horses, not people.

Getting on the damn Q line every day was absolutely awful, and I moved out of there as soon as I could afford to because frankly that city is disguisting. 

The city I'm currently living in is very nice, loads of trees between the big stuff, lots of space, lots of nature, all that jazz. 

bernieboy: Lol, have fun with your car payments, gas, maintenance, and wasting hundreds of hours in traffic for the rest of your life. I actually value my time, money, health, the environment etc.

TheMotorShitty: > Lol, have fun with your car payments

Lol, have fun in your dead city after you realize that the [auto industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_2008%E2%80%9310_automotive_industry_crisis_on_the_United_States) is the only thing keeping metro Detroit's head above water. 

bernieboy: How is this at all relevant to my comment? Why do you need to inject your obsessive hatred of Detroit into every thread? I literally didn't even mention the city in my comment.

TheMotorShitty: This is /r/urbanplanning and you can't develop a city without having a healthy economy first. Detroit's economy is highly dependent on the automotive sector and here you are trashing it. 

bernieboy: Cars weren't a problem until the government began massively subsidizing sprawl, highways etc. For the first couple decades of their existence, cars were basically just more comfortable/durable horse-and-buggies. They should be an option of transport, not a crutch to rely on. There's nothing wrong with the car itself, just that we've built our world to accommodate them. 

Detroit and its (increasingly diverse and overall decently strong) economy is not relevant to the conversation. 

TheMotorShitty: >They should be an option of transport, not a crutch to rely on.

If you change this, you will negatively impact Detroit. Fact. The economy here is not as diverse as you suggest. The three OEMs *alone* account for over 100,000 local jobs, many of which are good paying. When people drive less and purchase fewer cars, many local companies terminate local workers and many local workers, in turn, leave for greener pastures. The entire local economy spirals downward. See: 2008. 

So, here you are, saying that you want Detroit to come back while its dominant industry contracts. It doesn't work that way. The health of one is linked to the health of the other. Urban farms, hipster restaurants, and Quicken will never provide the same sort of economic engine. 

downvote_stormchaser: Then, as a Michigan resident myself, let's hope Detroit continues to decline or diversify away from autos for the sake of the other cities. Detroit strangled itself, no need to reach out and strangle others.

bernieboy: It's already been diversifying. Detroit has never relied on autos less than it does today; excluding when it was a fur trading post. 

TheMotorShitty: Detroit hasn't been diversifying: the auto industry has merely recovered from the downturn. If gas prices doubled tomorrow, this city would experience 2008 all over again.

bernieboy: You've got to be joking. The metro population has been growing still since 1950 - when automotive employment peaked. You're telling me the hundreds of thousands of auto jobs lost since then have all somehow stayed in auto? No. They moved into service, finance, tech, whatever. Detroits employment base is not as reliant on auto as it used to be and insisting otherwise is idiotic. We still depend on the market quite heavily, but we've been diversifying. 

TheMotorShitty: > The metro population has been growing still since 1950 

I was referring to recent years, since we only count trends since bankruptcy. Since you mentioned it, though, the decline of auto has ushered in an era of stagnation in the metro. The population in the metro hasn't changed much since 1970, whereas it used to grow. 

ButterflyStinger: > Detroit and its (increasingly diverse and overall decently strong) economy 

Was in agreeance with you until I saw that. Lmao

JobDestroyer: I live an hour away from my workplace, which is just under 40 miles away. There's pretty much no traffic on the way to work, nor on the way back. Driving allows me to live in the area in which I want to live, and not have to deal with the stupidity of city travel. Seriously, if it takes you an hour and a half to get to something that's 20 miles away, and you have to breath other peoples' ass breaths on the way there, you're living a shitty life. 

I've lived in cities that were built for horses. They're gay. I'll take cities built for humans any day over those monstrosities.

Meanwhile, I'll be listening to what I want at whatever volume I want, and getting to do something that's actually enjoyable: Driving my car. :)

bernieboy: > I live an hour away from my workplace, which is just under 40 miles away. There's pretty much no traffic on the way to work, nor on the way back.

That's 2 hours a day that you sit in a car, doing nothing. That's very detrimental to your health.

>Driving allows me to live in the area in which I want to live, and not have to deal with the stupidity of city travel.

TIL having options on how I can get to where I want is stupid. Sorry I don't want to rely on the crutch of an automobile to survive.

>Seriously, if it takes you an hour and a half to get to something that's 20 miles away, and you have to breath other peoples' ass breaths on the way there, you're living a shitty life.

Well, statistically, people living in cities are healthier and happier than people living in situations like your own - and you're giving us a good example of that unhappiness.

>I've lived in cities. They're gay.

Stop.

>Meanwhile, I'll be listening to what I want at whatever volume I want

Damn, I forgot I can't listen to music with earbuds on the bus. If only I could also read, do homework, talk on the phone, browse the internet, catch up on Netflix, finish a paper while riding public transit as well..

>and getting to do something that's actually enjoyable: Driving my car. :)

It's kind of unusual that your commute is a source of happiness for you, but more power to you. Lots of us like walking, biking, or relaxing on a train too.

None: [removed]

jordmiller: So what you're saying is that the government should just subsidize anything that a majority of people like, regardless of the costs. 

gres06: You realize how much money the government pours into roads and keeping gas cheap? 

infestans: Cities enjoy having intercourse with other cities of the same sex?

alexfrancisburchard: It's cool that you like driving, but not everyone is you. That's what you're ignoring. 

I actually also love driving, its incredibly fun. When I'm not forced to do it every day of my life. I enjoy driving on rare occasions when I'm back home in Seattle or something. But for my day to day life, I vastly prefer walking as much as possible, it helps me get fit, and if I ever achieve fitness, it will help me stay fit. I also hate driving in traffic it puts me to sleep and that's dangerous. I vastly prefer the city to the country. I want to be able to lower a bucket out my window and do my grocery shopping (I can do that where I live). Or walk 3 blocks and see 5 grocery stores (I can also do that). Everything I need for living I can find within 8 blocks of my apartment. I love that. I can walk to see my friends, I can walk to fun things in the city, like the nightlife districts, Kadikoy (walk + a gorgeous ferry ride), or Taskim (Just walk). I can walk to a teahouse by the sea, I can walk to coffee houses to sit and chat with friends or play board games and backgammon, etc. That makes me happy, and most of my friends are very similar to me, they like walking, or at least, being able to walk, and failing that, take a clean bus that comes every 2-6 minutes and is as fast as a cab. (or the metro which if someone bet me 15TL to eat something off the seats of I probably would because its always so clean). 

The other thing is that in cities we can't all have cars. We physically don't have space for it. EVeryone in NYC can't drive, there would be infinite gridlock. If everyone in Istanbul drove the entire city(buildings, parks, roads, open spaces) would need to be built atop a 2-5 story parking garage just to park all the cars, and then places to drive those cars? Ha. With 14% car usage we're the 6th most congested city on the planet. Physically Impossible. (Thank god car ownership rates here are declining)

No one here likes driving in the city, but plenty of people do it because they choose to live across town from their work. Hopefully the city will have more metro options in the near future (well, I know it will, 15ish more lines by 2023) Metro will make their commutes reliable, instead of highly variable between 30-300 minutes. I have friends who live in bahcesehir and commute to the city center, I don't know why, but their commutes take 45-180 minutes. bus, car doesn't matter, same speed. Metro in 2021ish will be awesome from that neighborhood. most of that line opens next year, I'm excited because it is my neighborhood's second metro line, and it goes to the two busy ferry terminals! 

Anyways - point is, some people like living in cities. In fact, to use your logic, many many more people like it than do it, judging by city-center housing prices. They're ridiculously high because we don't allow enough new housing in our city centers. Tons and tons more people want to move to city centers and only live in the burbs because that's what they can reasonably afford, not because it is truly what they want.

MoonliteJaz: I gotta ask, how heavy is it? I'm looking at going 10S5P and Dual 6374(from 6355) and the weight is already a little hard to handle. 

Fauxvoice: How fast is your top speed with the 6355's?

GrafiteLTE: At 10s and 90mm wheels I top out at 32MPH (I weigh 175lbs). I love it's torque, but I want a little more sometimes. 

ispooler: It's heavy but less than my Trampa Street Carver, however it's like a big motorcycle, once you are on it it feels like a feather extremely maneuverable and I can lift it and carry it with one hand very easily from the front trucks.

On a brightside the board feel more stable at 30mph with that weight 

Dogman1247: How you like it vs the street carver? I got a kaly nyc street carver 2 in 1

ispooler: I just weighted it, it's 10.8kg (23.76lb). Pretty much a good weight for the specs 

ispooler: Well it's a completely different board, the Trampa is a much more expensive board, maybe double the price of this build.

This one is easier to carry, less weight, it sits lower to the ground, so you have more clearance with the urban carver.

The feeling is pretty much similar than the street carver in terms of power and handling, the look is nice on both boards, both being completely different style
