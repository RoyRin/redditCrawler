Thanks for the awesome bot! Once I set up an alert, will the bot continue to alert me even if the thread I posted in falls out of the top 50? Or does my alert request need to be in a top 50 post to stay active?

Thanks again!

SoundsLikeBrian, This is such a cool idea, but I'm wondering if I should be doing something differently. I have an alert set up for Bob Dylan and I got a notification ten minutes ago for a post that went up early yesterday. 

Also noticed a delayed message for Miles Davis' Birth of Cool.

edit: additional question... can I edit my original post to add artists, or should I just set up another alert? and if I do that, it won't override my first one, right? THANK YOU!!!!

newtohomebrewing, I know. I debated putting it in both ways since it gets used with and without the umlaut. I’ll add the proper spelling.

WELCOME New Apple Owners! To Save You Time & Headaches, Here's A "Master List" Of Resources!
https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/15gpaq/welcome_new_apple_owners_to_save_you_time/ 
ratio:2.888888888888889: 
 

radium-v, * [BetterTouchTool](http://www.boastr.de/) - whole bunch of touchpad gesture config options
* [Flux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) - adjust the screen temperature based on the time of day
* [Crossover](http://www.codeweavers.com/products/) - for running Windows programs inside Mac (works great with older games)
* [Secrets](http://secrets.blacktree.com/) - A control panel plugin with loads of system tweak options
* [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) - A free and open-source alternative to Microsoft Word
* [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) - A Terminal replacement for Mac.
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - Compatible with all TextMate plugins and bundles

* [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/) - Free streaming music. Over 18 million tracks.

Guides:

None, iStat Menu's?
DublinItUp, If I may, I think instead of including VLC in there you should instead use MPlayerX, it works much better.
None, Why no [Libre Office?](http://www.libreoffice.org/)

Edit: Also [OWC](http://www.macsales.com/) for parts and mods

Edit 2: Looks like they were added!
bitigchi, Let's not forget [Onyx](http://www.titanium.free.fr/downloadonyx.php), the great maintenance software out there. 
damienbarrett, You're really recommending the Tor Browser Bundle to novice users?

I'm sure you're aware that when you run Tor, or TBB (which includes Vidalia, etc.), you're opening your computer up to be a node on the Tor anonymizer network. And so you're inviting your computer to be used for any nefarious purposes that another Tor user might be doing, who is using Tor to try to disguise or mask his/her activities. Illegal P2P filesharing of copyrighted material, distribution of child pornography, website-hacking, terrorism, etc. These are all things that might be occurring at any time on the Tor network, and might be occuring on your computer without your knowledge, if you open your machine up to be a Tor node.

I know this sounds alarmist, like some shrill doofus screaming that the sky is falling. But I'm very serious. Tor itself is not a bad thing. It has some amazing and legitimate uses. But novice users should best steer clear of it until they can better judge what any software they install might be doing while it's running on their computer.
TinyLebowski, The link to iStat Pro Widget was dead. Here's an [alternative](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20364/istat-pro).
None, Evernote is a pretty great note taking program. It's free, and you can sync it with your iOS device so you can have your notes on the go.
no-mad, Hardware- macsales.com has been good to me over the years.
Subliminal7, Okay, I've updated the post as much as I could, but as stated I don't own a lot of Apple products. I could use help with iOS devices..if I should even put them on here.

Thanks for everyone's input!
None, What do you recommend for battery life? I have the MBP Retina model and my strategy is to keep it plugged in (it sits on my desk 24/7) and then once a week on Sunday, letting it drain and then charging it back up.
None, Ok, one last thing. Did anyone else just start having problems with youtube, for example "An error has occurred, please try again later" It's been happening for the past couple of hours and tried multiple browsers.
noughtagroos, Thank you, and all those who made helpful suggestions for additions!
None, THANK YOU! I had been unable to find anything in user forums to advise on Adobe Flash…but your link had the de-bug installer and was exactly what I needed. Grateful me!
stompsfrogs, [Open Office](http://www.openoffice.org/) free, opens more MSOffice formats than MSOffice does.

I only need to run one small Windows program, so I prefer [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) over Parallels. Parallels was a memory hog that shitted up all my menus. Also vb is free. I switched when Parallels wanted me to buy another license to upgrade from Snow Leopard, cuz I already bought a license so fuck that noise.

[Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) free image manipulation software. Now native and no longer requires stupid X11.

Calibre for anything to do with converting or streaming ebooks, Inkscape for vector files, Sketchup for simple 3D models, unetbootin for making live Linux flash drives and AppCleaner for taking care of those wee files that get left behind and crap your crap up when you delete apps all get honorable mentions for being great at what they do even if I only use them once in awhile.
Takeabyte, > As someone pointed out not so nicely

Sounds like someone is bitter.
ujelly_fish, Just curious and clueless, but what is the point of getting LibreOffice, exactly? Or iTerm2, if Terminal is functioning? 
Takeabyte, Heck ya!
Takeabyte, Will MPlayerX work with Handbrake instead of VLC?

I'm not knocking MPlayerX, I've never used it. VLC is a solid player and one a new Mac user might recognize coming from a Windows PC.

Edit: Guess it doesn't matter anymore... https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/SupportFAQ#vlc
Ultmast, I'd also recommend [IceClean](http://www.macdentro.com/MacDentro/Home.html), in the same vein.
None, Let's also not forget to tell people not to go crazy with system maintenance.  OS X does most of the stuff for you.  Also, if you blindly run everything on Onyx you will fuck your shit up.  Use things like Onyx has a tool to correct issues if they arrise.  For example, cleaning the launch services if you start seeing duplicate entries in your Open With menu.
TinyMontgomerySaysHi, You have to voluntarily set up your computer as a relay. Simply using Tor does not do any of the things you're talking about. [Source](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en)
Subliminal7, You're talking about an exit node, where yours and others traffic can be seen plainly.

Also, tor is for privacy online, no matter the uses. Similar to the bit torrent protocol being designed for easier transfer of large files, not solely piracy.
WaruiKoohii, That's fine.

Batteries degrade whether you use them or not. All you can do is slow the degradation.

Try not to drain the battery completely very often. It's not good for the battery. 
Subliminal7, I think the biggest thing to avoid is a lot of charge/discharge cycles. 

You can calibrate your battery to improve life. I've heard they're calibrated from factory and I've also heard they're not. Either way, [here](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1490) is an Apple Knowledgebase article on how to calibrate a Mac's battery properly. From personal experience, I can tell you that after four months of ownership, I calibrated my battery and saw an improvement--from ~3 hours to about 6 hours, with the same usage.
Takeabyte, http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html

Please note:

> Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time.
Subliminal7, YouTube may be experiencing issues due to the weather (Netflix was down yesterday or day before due to Amazon datacenter outage due to weather in VA IIRC):

http://downrightnow.com/youtube
Takeabyte, I think the issue is Flash. It is a CPU hog and errors are the norm.
Subliminal7, The not so nice was a small joke. Obviously, you didn't say GTFO FAGGOT, nor did I call you out as if I was bitter. I am running on 15+ hours and no sleep, so I wasn't thinking clearly. Thank you for your input. I've tried my best to fix it.

If you have more suggestions, I'd appreciate it!
radium-v, LibreOffice is great when you don't want to pay for Powerpoint, but need to open Powerpoint documents. Just another of many Office Suite alternatives.

iTerm2 has much more functionality than the standard Terminal. For instance, you can set up a hotkey for a Quake-like window (the window drops down from the top, like window roller blinds)
DublinItUp, I just prefer MPlayerX personally, I have no idea if it will work with Handbrake, but probably. Also, MPlayerX will play any extension you choose, it's great, I really like the look of it too.
None, I haven't done a fresh install of Handbreak in a while, but if I remember correctly, the current version of VLC doesn't supply what it needs anymore.  You just need some file that Handbreak points you to vs it telling you to install VLC.

So in short... VLC vs MPlayerX doesn't matter at all when it comes to Handbrake.
inajeep, He still has a valid point and something a possible novice user should be aware of.  
Takeabyte, This... http://www.apple.com/batteries/

Apple's been sued so many times forever battery stuff, they know their shit now lol!

Also, the list is looking good. I don;t know if there is a way to clean up that chart you made for upgrades but waterer. =D
None, Thanks!
daren_sf, Thanks for compiling that. You might add a note for students purchasing any hardware, software and/or accessories reminding them to see if their school offers any student discounts. It's surprising how many forget. 
Takeabyte, Okay... one more suggestion. Get some rest lol!
ujelly_fish, Oh makes sense, I got powerpoint for free from my college. I'm not sure iTerm2 would be something a beginner might use, but it certainly could be helpful depending on what you like. Thank you. 
BangsNaughtyBits,    Handbrake used libraries from VLC to decrypt DVDs for transcoding encrypted DVDs.  It's not absolutely required but very useful.

!
Takeabyte, https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/SupportFAQ#vlc

Guess you're right.
TinyMontgomerySaysHi, What's the point? Using Tor doesn't make your computer a relay without you explicitly configuring it to do so. What novice users need in this case is accurate information.
Subliminal7, Can't :( I have insomnia and I've taken more than enough meds, but still no luck!
radium-v, A new Apple owner may not be a new-to-computers beginner. I'm a programmer, and when I switched from Windows to Mac, I had to adjust to all sorts of new stuff - download new apps to match what I was used to, retrain my brain for hotkeys, and remember that the X button doesn't always quit the application. Luckily a lot of open-source projects are compatible with many different operating systems.
damienbarrett, Can I send all my novice users to you when they FUBAR their Mac from installing things like Tor? I'm not necessarily anti-Tor or anti-privacy (as I said before), but I feel that novice users should avoid things like Tor and Bittorrent until they know more.

Furthermore, there are many businesses and organizations whose IT departments prohibit the installations of proxies or software like Tor (for any number of reasons). A novice user could find him or herself in a prickly situation if he/she installed Tor or Privoxy (or even something like LittleSnitch) on their work Mac. Yes, you are correct that novice users need accurate information, but I'm going to hold to my original point: software like Tor doesn't really belong on a list of recommended software for new or novice Mac users.
Takeabyte, Well the giant light bulb in front of you (aka, your display) might do that to you.

On a more serious note, I'm sorry for coming off as rude. I hope you manage to get some rest soon.
Takeabyte, Here is a short list I made the other day, you have some of it already but whatever, I just copied and pasted.

[HandBrake](http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php): Converts any DVD or video file so it will work in iTunes or on any iOS devise.

[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html): Needed to allow HandBrake to work. Also a universal medial player in case QuickTime sucks.

[Perian](http://perian.org): Makes QuickTime suck less.

[Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com): Best Mac bit torrent client.

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com): Personal file sharing.

[Flip4Mac/Silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=9442): Flip4Mac allows you to view .wmv files in QuickTime. Silverlight is for Netflix.

[Flash](http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html): Cause we have to.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/): For when Safari sucks.

[Google Earth](http://www.google.com/earth/index.html): When you're high and want to look at shit on your Retina display for 5 hours.

[Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp): Cause we have to.

[NTFS for Mac](http://www.seagate.com/support/external-hard-drives/desktop-hard-drives/backup-plus-desk/ntfs-driver-for-mac-os-master-dl/): Normally $20, free on Segate's website. Allows you to see NTFS drives on your Mac.

[Steam](http://store.steampowered.com): When you just have to kill a zombie or five hundred, nothing beats the Steam store and some Left 4 Dead 2 (or other game of your choice).

Here are some places (besides Amazon and Ebay) where users can find parts for their broken Macs...

http://www.macpartsonline.com

http://www.powerbookmedic.com

http://www.ifixit.com/Mac-Parts
Takeabyte, But while you're up here are my thoughts on your list so far.

Try and bring more of the common user friendly apps to the top.

Get rid of that anti-virus. Corporations that scan for that over a network typically look for their own licenses of Norton or McAffee. But whatever, an antivirus on the list can't hurt.

Apple's Video guides are a joke now a days. Move it down your list, people will get disappointed when they see the choices.

While not something for a new Mac user, someone who is upgrading their Mac might want to do a bench test or compare their new Mac to others around the world... [Xbench](http://xbench.com)

Don't forget [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html) and [Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp) don't come on Macs anymore.

Okay, that's all. I promise.

Go to sleep... after you fix those last few things.
TinyMontgomerySaysHi, IT concerns are one thing, but your reasons for excluding Tor from this list in your initial comment weren't real.
Subliminal7, Haha, that is true. And no worries :) take care
Subliminal7, My university scanned for any, so I just downloaded Sophos as it was

1. free

and

2. not Norton or McAfee :)

Taking note of order of lists. Thinking about writing or linking to stuff that Apple videos cover if they are that bad.
Takeabyte, As far as I know, there are just five videos now.

Three on iTunes, one on sharing in iMove, and one about Windows on a Mac.

They are okay, but... it's just... sigh... Apple used to have so many more. I mean well over a hundred short little things that went over e-ver-y-thing just a couple years ago. My friend at the Apple Store tells me Apple got rid of them all because they made it part of the $99 [One to One](http://www.apple.com/retail/learn/one-to-one/) service you can only get when you buy a new Apple product (sucks for anyone who wants to save a little money and buys used if you ask me). 
Takeabyte, The best video guides are found at http://www.lynda.com. There is a $25/m fee but totally worth it since you can learn not just Apple stuff but just about anything that has to do with a computer.

diewhitegirls, Erm, PMU reset is not correct. That's a PRAM/NVRAM reset. PMU is the SMC for Power PC machines.
TheBestUkester, Fantastic write up. As another former Genius turned Apple Support Specialist, nicely done.
bwolf457, As a current Genius, this man types truth.  Everything he mentioned we still do and I do pretty much everyday.  +1
Stone-D, Good post, should be useful for many. You may want to clarify further on SMC though.  ;)

Anyway... Merry Christmas!
happycj, Excellent job! I was in Apple support back in the early 1990's, and it seems the process hasn't changed much: Figure out what is actually wrong, fix the actual cause of the problem, and the symptoms will go away. Most everything a user experiences is a symptom of some problem that has been going on for a while, but the symptoms have only recently risen into view of the user.

Thanks for going through all the work to write this out. I hope it helps improve the quality of questions asked of r/AppleHelp.
haikuginger, This needs to go in the sidebar.
Gothbot6k, You didn't mention fsck or how to do that in single user mode... saved my butt more times then I can imagine.
None, [deleted]

Troll__McLure, Welcome and thanks for this post. 

^((If the original complaining thread—which I'd consider stupid as hell—, did one good thing, then to lead you to this subreddit.)^)
lumpofcole, I'm surprised this hasn't been posted, but in the case of forgetting an admin password:

1) Restart to recovery partition (Ctrl+R on startup) or from Mac OS X Install DVD (C on startup)

2) Go to Utilities Menu. If you see Reset Password, click it. If you don't see it, click Terminal and type 'resetpassword' and press Return.

3) Follow the instructions, save, and restart your computer.
MacGuy247, Great info!  Haha there's been a few times I forgot the hot keys and find myself doing a quick google search for them...  No more searching!  This should really be on the side board.
andrewthemexican, Another thing I would put in when pulling the user-specific files, you want to make sure to pull the .plist, and not the .plist.lockfile. Also would suggest restarting the computer when you remove that so the OS can create the new one. Depending on the issue the reboot might be necessary with pulling the plist.

Then for slowdowns or permissions issues, there is of course Verify/Repair Disk, and Verify/Repair Disk Permissions in Disk Utility. And anytime doing repair permissions, always reboot the computer.

Then for Safari issues: there is resetting Safari, emptying the cache (in Safari 6, under Reset Safari "Remove All Website Data"), and safebooting Safari (Have Safari quit/closed, hold the Shift key while opening).

Internet/network connectivity: If you're having an issue in the browser, first thing I check is iTunes Store to see if it loads or not to determine if browser-specific, or computer connectivity issue.

Just some additional things for people.
ICasual, Thanks! It's been awhile since I had to deal with PowerPC macs. Must have gotten mixed up. 
None, [deleted]
ICasual, True. Safe boot performs an FSCK, I believe. But single user is helpful. I'll expand this out when I have some time. 
None, You can use the 30 day trial version of the app [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com) to clone the OS to an external drive. Then you can option key boot to that drive to help troubleshoot system problems.
None, It's honestly no different than installing to an internal drive. You run the installer, choose the drive (internal, USB, firewire, thunderbolt) and tell it to install.

If it doesn't show the drive you want, then it probably isn't formatted/partitioned correctly. Modern Macs will only boot from a GUID/Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) drive. Most external drives out fo the box will be partitioned and formatted for Windows computers. Just use Disk utility to erase the drive and set it up correctly.
ICasual, I'd test it in the following steps:

1. Do any other devices have issues connecting? Yes? It's the iPhone (Doubt it, but that's where you start.)
2. Try the PMU and SMC resets on the iMac. (Listed above.) 
3. If possible, try an external hard drive. See if it's software or hardware. 
4. If it works on the external, you'll need to find the system setting that is in charge of the network that is causing the kernel panic, or just re-install the OS. 
5. If it doesn't work on the external, it's a hardware issue. Probably needs a new AirPort card. 
ICasual, That's a good one. However in Mountain lion and lion the process got a lot more complicated. I'll be sure to add this to the main section. 
Takeabyte, It's people like you that give Apple techs a bad name.

Now, how do I instal Windows on my iTouch?
happycj, Most people look at the symptom currently facing them, rather than stepping back and looking at the whole.

It's the classic, "My screen doesn't work" thing. Is the screen completely dark? yes. Is there a little green light in the corner? no. Is the power cord plugged in? yes. Is the cord connected to the computer?

"The what?"

The box under the monitor. Is the monitor plugged in to it?

"I thought that was a stand."

OK. Turn on your computer.

"Wow! The screen works!"


People look at the symptom and get myopically fixated on it, and miss the bigger picture. OP's process avoids that nicely.
Gothbot6k, Yeah in my personal experience if something isn't running right or if something odd is going on or a glitch of some sort an FSCK will fix it 9/10 times. Although I've had the same issue with my iMac since I got it 3 years ago and no matter what version of OSX I'm on no matter what mouse I use whenever I go to click close on something it minimizes it instead. Most specifically with safari but I have had it happen with other programs. I just figure it's something wrong with the mac.
no-mad, Can also be done on a 8GB USB key.
andrewthemexican, He did include the Lion/Mountain Lion steps there, what with the Recovery Partition and Terminal.

/current Applecare advisor.
ICasual, All the time, or some of the time?
andrewthemexican, In my time at Applecare tech support, never have I specifically done FSCK outside of safeboot.

Only time in single-user mode is resetting passwords on older systems without an install DVD.
Gothbot6k, All of the time. Ever since I got it. I've tried upgrading and downgrading the OS nothing fixes it. I've just learned to live with the fact that every time I go to close a window it will minimize instead and I have to pull it back up and close it again.
Gothbot6k, Wow really? FSCK is my go to problem fixer for just about everything. There have only been 2 problems in my life that it hasn't fixed and those were hardware issues... well aside from my current iMac problem.
ICasual, Let me clarify. Every single time, or most of the time? Does anything else click what's right to the right of it?
andrewthemexican, The minimize issue, does it actually minimize and put it to the right of the divider on the dock, or is it appearing closed but app still open (by light on dock), and you click it and just opens to that window again?

But yeah, FSCK pretty much never used by me. And to gloat a little, I'm the technical go-to guy by a lot of the folks I work with. Just there's a lot of other alternatives depending upon the issue.
Gothbot6k, Yes but it's mostly with Safari. It's happened with itunes, word,finder windows and it's hit or miss but occasionally terminal. And the app store I basically have to force quit otherwise I'll be there for 10 minutes trying to close that thing...
Gothbot6k, It minimizes it to the right divider.

Also I am also the go to tech guy for just about everything in my neighborhood and in my family. It's so easy to use for me so it's what I use all the time now. I can even run it without needing a screen which is helpful for people with mac pros that have graphics cards that aren't supported officially.
ICasual, Sorry, which one, every time or most of the time?
andrewthemexican, Interesting issue. I saw you mentioned some troubleshooting stuff. Erase and installs, without importing data? Chances are it wouldn't persist there.

I'd probably go into dock/finder.plists on it. Perhaps repair permissions as well. I missed the full thread you had with the genius on it.
Gothbot6k, Every time with Safari and most of the time with everything else. ALL the time with App store. It acts different for each program.
Gothbot6k, Yeah they are all fresh installs no restoring of any kind. And I have repaired the permissions and still nothing. It's only specific to this one iMac. I took it into the Apple store once and they said they fixed it but they really didn't do anything.
ICasual, What happens if you choose to close the window under the menu bar options? Does it close or minimize?
andrewthemexican, Interesting. Sounds like a request to Engineering to me.
Gothbot6k, It will close then
Gothbot6k, Well it's a three year old machine (going on 4) so it's pointless now. I've just learned to live with it. I maxed out the machine with ram and put in a 1.5tb drive (I opened it so they won't work on it now) and the dvd drive is going as well and a fan's ball bearings are messed up so whenever I first start it up it sounds like a chainsaw revving up but once logged in it stops. So I've just learned to live with the quirks.
andrewthemexican, Makes sense. It's definitely a minor kind of thing, and nothing as severe as say a panic or permissions issues.
Gothbot6k, Yeah don't get me started on Kernel Panics. I went through 4 Powermac G5's in the time span of 3 years. 3 of them just would not stop getting Kernel Panics.

Two Prisoners in Mississippi County Still Awaiting Trial after 6 and 7 Years

theoffdutyninja21, Before I even read the article I knew they must be talking about Hinds County. I just got out of the jail in Raymond this past Wednesday.  It's not just the defense attorneys. The jail is run by a bunch of incompetent inadequate staff who don't do their job and are highly unqualified to do so. I was sentenced to the RID program in Greene County SMCI and upon completion I was ordered to go BACK to Hinds County for Judicial review. I was nervous I'd get stuck. And guess what... Got stuck 2 extra days AFTER being released by my judge. They just don't want to do any paperwork, let alone ANYTHING pertaining to work. 33 men in a holding cell. No exaggeration. No phone call until you're booked in which may take up to 24 hours or more and that's IF they even decide to let you use it. While in booking holding cells, despite remaining possibly 2-3 weeks on filthy concrete floors before being moved to a pod in the back (once again, no exaggeration) you won't be allowed to shower. The riot that just took place that's been on the news lately where allegedly 1 inmate died...no, 4 died. But you won't hear or read about that in the news.  I foresee internal affairs coming down hard on that place very soon. I understand that jail is supposed to be an unpleasant experience, but Raymond Detention Center is inhumane. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Sheriff Tyrone Lewis isn't going to tell you what's really going on down there. He along with the majority of MDOC, more specifically the Hinds County Sheriff's Department are a bunch of incompetent crooked goons. 
0011002, Doesn't this violate their right to a speedy and fair trial?
PacmanNemesis, I haven't been to jail but hospitals can be bad when they get a patient called in for being mental. I displaced a rib and ended up getting pissed off when no one believed it hurt, I was called in as suicidal and treated as such. After being isolated for hours trying hard to get someone to help, when asking one nurse why a doctor hadn't come seen me she said they were too busy and I was a low priority. When I tried to explain the pain, she leaned forward quickly interrupting me, and with such disdain said, "you know exactly why you're here, you're not in pain," then she stormed off. I was there for 10 hours before a social worker talked to me for 30 minutes then I was released being told to see my pcp about my rib, did that but because the er reported how I was sent in for suicide my doc assumed just like the er staff that I was just crazy so most that appointment was spent with a therapist. This is just one instance, part of my family thinks it's cute to call in suicide threats, even though I completely cut them out and don't talk to them. Certain stigmas can cause people a ton of problems, and even if I were suicidal I feel I should still get help for physical problems. Jail, medical, government, this country is just flawed and people like us go unheard.
zephyer19, County jail in New Mexico placed a guy in solitary and forgot to do his paperwork.  He set there for two years waiting to see a judge.  One of his teeth rotted and he pulled it out with his fingers.
Someone finally got the word out about him and a lawyer got him out along with a few million.

My cousin was a school teacher in the same jail for juvees and said she was scared to death the whole time.  
She figured the place was due for a major riot or break and didn't want to be a female there if it happened.
She took retirement as soon as she could.

Seems like law suits are the only thing that keeps this stuff straight.  Takes forever and costs us way to much.
And a lot of the bad guards are due to poor pay and over sight.
samus1225, So theyre still in jail bc they havent gone to trial bc they dont have adequate representation? Reminds me of how the state school board turned down millions of dollars from NASA bc mississippi didnt have enough workers to bookkeep the money...
transhumanz, Having spent 24 hours in Raymond in the drunk tank, I can testify it's all true.  Even on single misdemeanor offenses they jerk you around, stall, drag ass and basically uphold due process as long as they can.  It must have been 15-20 hours before I was allowed a phone call.  The courthouse is at least an hour drive away in the paddy wagon, round trip 4-5 hours, during which nothing about your process progresses.  If I didn't have someone outside helping me bail out I would have been there days.
None, Done.

Mac1822, Be mad at the courts and lawyers, its not the jails fault court cases take years.  
chinchilled, http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2014/04/21/hinds-county-set-ask-jackson-jail-money/7979409/

This is part of the problem. If anyone knows anything about Jackson, MS it's basically a cesspool similar to Detroit. Jackson just lets Hinds County deal with it and barely helps them out financially in return.
None, Hey! I live in Hinds County! We're Famous!
enokeenu, If you are in jail pre-trial and are mistreated you should be able to sue someone about it
LuckyGoGo, it is run by blacks, what did you expect.
None, Wait a government run operation is incompetent? Get out here everything else they do runs so smoothly. I laugh because these same people whining about civil rights of a criminal are the same people that think the government should control more things. 
Skitscatpaddywhack, Maybe the offdutyninja21 shouldn't of broken the law and got his ass in jail?
None, Well a guy who was in the jail said it.  It must be true and complete information.  
vlevron, Don't break the law and you won't get treated inhumanely in PRISON!!!!  Derp!  Let the downvoting begin.... I wish more prisons were like the one in Arizona, maybe the crime rate would drop. 

downvote_koenig, Criminals deserve a lot worse that what they get. The American justice system is too kind.
walterscottmartin, Why are we concerned with the protection of inmates rights. These people chose to commit crimes for which they are punished. Upon receipt of punishment all rights should be forfeit. As it currently stands we're too soft on criminals. I think their lives should be spent doing labor. The harder the better.

The riot that just took place that's been on the news lately where allegedly 1 inmate died...no, 4 died. But you won't hear or read about that in the news. I foresee internal affairs coming down hard on that place very soon. I understand that jail is supposed to be an unpleasant experience, but Raymond Detention Center is inhumane. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Sheriff Tyrone Lewis isn't going to tell you what's really going on down there. He along with the majority of MDOC, more specifically the Hinds County Sheriff's Department are a bunch of incompetent crooked goons.

There are obvious and systematic potential violations of the prisoner's rights to habeas corpus and due process here.
 
In addition, because these inhumane conditions apply to men and boys and apparently not women and girls, and because they likely have a disproportionate impact based on race, they may be violating the rights of prisoners under several important US civil rights laws and under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Because prisoners are not booked while imprisoned, they are effectively held as non-persons, so all of their civil rights are probably ignored. These include the right to equal access to health care, the same access provided women and girl prisoners, under the nondiscrimination provisions for *all* government funded health services in the Affordable Care Act, and the right to equal access to screening for and services to victims of domestic violence, the same access as women and girl prisoners, under the 2013 VAWA reauthorization.

I urge you to also investigate these issues. Until action is taken to faithfully protect the civil rights of all Americans, those whose rights are violated must hope for justice, and persevere.

None, What you just described sounds like Harris County jail in Houston, TX.  The jail cops do not give 2 fucks about anyone there, and they are incredibly lazy.  We watched one 14 year old girl back in 2005 get beaten by four jail guards all because she was crying and carrying on too loudly.  They pulled her out of the holding cell and we could hear her screams and the actual "thuds" of her body being hit.  By the time they brought her back in her clothes were torn and she was a bloody mess.  There had to have been at least 25 women all huddled in a holding cell for up to 48 hours.  There was partial vomit on an open toilet where the drinking fountain was on the toilet itself.  No privacy open there so everyone can watch you piss.  One lady had her period and no pads and bled all over the concrete bench and floor.  There was no place to sit or lay and the cell was filthy to very unhealthy standards.  When they brought food the jailers wouldn't even put one foot in the holding cell to give folks their food, instead they threw sandwiches at people, some falling onto the filthy floor for those who were not quick enough to catch the sandwich.  I always wondered how that jail got away with these very inhumane conditions.
OnlySlightlyFamous, I don't know why you were in jail but I'm sorry that it was such a shitty experience for you.  And that may sound funny but I was a CO for many years and I worked my ass off to make sure that the inmates under my care weren't abused or mistreated and that they were allowed all of their rights and privileges.  

>  jail is supposed to be an unpleasant experience

No, a properly run jail isn't supposed to be unpleasant.  It's not designed to be fun and its not supposed to be a place anyone would want to hang out but, its also not supposed to be unpleasant.  I wish that I could change everyone's mindset on this issue.  CO's that get the idea that they are supposed to be doling out punishment to their inmates are dangerous and give the good guys a bad name...

Again, I'm sorry that you had to suffer in Raymond Detention Center.  I hope they get what is coming to them and I hope that you are able to move past it all and leave that place behind.
None, >  I understand that jail is supposed to be an unpleasant experience

I complained about the condition the the King County Jail in Seattle, WA. I was booked there and it was only a miracle I remembered the right phone number to call (think: how many phone numbers do you actually *know* now that we use contact lists for everything?) Otherwise I would have been stuck for a week awaiting arraignment.

Also a miracle I got the message through in under a minute. The calls were collect, with a free minute, but to buy collect calls you had to buy time which was a complicate process I didn't understand that would take at least a day if I were even able to do it at all.

Anyway someone told me, when I also added the caveat that 'yea I know jail should be bad, but...' that being booked in jail should not be unpleasant. You have not been convicted of anything. You are awaiting trial. You should be held in detention and be made aware of why you are in detention, for how long, and what your options are for trial (i.e. phone to call a lawyer immediately). 
KING_TYRANT_LIZARD, I've had friends who have spent time there.  My one friend got locked up on a Tuesday, and didn't get to see a judge until the next Tuesday.  He never showed up to school or band practice, we assumed he was dead.  He described it as just that.
the_real_xuth, _Jail_ should not necessarily be an unpleasant experience.  A very large percentage of the people in jails have not been convicted of anything and many of those people are completely innocent.
7V3N, I had a similar experience in VA. I had to go to jail for a couple nights for reckless driving, but it ended up being 4 and I waited the 2 nights without ever really being told what I was waiting for. Literally for the whole day where I expected to be released I was told "Yeah, it should be any minute now." I waited from midnight to 4 (which I only knew because I asked a patrolling guard--we didn't have clocks) without anybody ever telling me why I was still waiting, because I thought "Okay, this is it. I'm getting out soon." The next day, I asked and was told they were processing paperwork. The next morning I was then released as if nothing went wrong. I was told some paperwork went missing, but I was never apologized to. I had to wait 2 days to be told that I was being held 2 extra days for no just reason.
  
Edit: It was not as bad as I expected. The worst parts were boredom and hygiene, since I had to sleep on the floor with cockroaches and the shower barely worked at all (which nobody used). I just wanted to clarify this is not some guy just bitching because he had to pay the consequences.
  
Edit2: I forgot to mention that I also had only enough of my medication--some of which was for anxiety--for those days, so I was spending the last 2 without, and none of them seemed to care. I even had a panic attack while waiting that night between midnight and 4am. Just the frustration of waiting and waiting and waiting. Again, not trying to bitch--I just found it amazing/horrifying how dehumanized you are.

olemiss1, I practice law in Hinds County. I can't remember the last time I had a client who had been in Raymond who had a good experience. Sadly, this is the experience in many county jails throughout the state. It's common for people to sit in jail for a week before seeing a judge. The MDOC prisons are often not much better. Reform may be on the way. The governor seems to understand that the system isn't working, especially in regard to low-level offenders. The legislature has followed suit. The issue is that the reform still comes in the form of money for more prosecutors and the like, but the actual status of incarceration in the state remains largely unchanged. 
None, And this is why all people should get their right to vote back after sentence complete. I've been saying it for years...who knows the problems inside other than those that have been there?

The jail system is self serving in its own corruption.

EDIT - I say this as a man with a security  clearance and nearly had a felony due to some of the bullshit that happens within the legal system. My performance prior to accusations is ALL that saved me.
xX_CorpusDei_Xx, Its the same story in Lee County. Tupelo cops regularly beat citizens and nothing is ever done about it. The detention center is even worse. Ive heard stories of severe beatings and sexual assault. I personally spent 36 hrs in a 5' x 8' holding cell with 25 other people. They brought this elderly black man in in the middle of the night. He was drunk and then pooped his pants. When the guards found out he crapped his pants they came in the cell, smacked him around a bit and then left him bruised and soiled for several hours. They later took him out and hosed him down. Its was sickening. 

foramen_magnum, I had to pick up someone there that was arrested for DUI. After hours of waiting, we had to come back for her the next night. The workers there were complete assholes to us.
DrSlightlyLessDoom, This is the state of our society. The prisons and jails are just the tools to subvert, constrain and control an entire class of people within a society. The inhumane treatment is a byproduct of this. To quote Foucault:

"It seems to me that whether the prisoners get an extra chocolate bar on Christmas or are let out to make their Easter Duty is not the real political issue. What we have to denounce is not so much the "human" side of life in prison but rather their real social function-that is, to serve as the instrument that creates a criminal milieu that the ruling classes can control."

Attack the systemic problems at hand.

UpvotesKnowledge, I'm fucking ashamed of the two states I've lived in, Mississippi and Alabama. The corruption in both states is rampant but no one seems to give a fuck because its all boonies around here. 
Dr__House, > No phone call until you're booked in which may take up to 24 hours or more and that's IF they decide to let you use it.

Devils Advocate here of sorts. Those conditions sound inhumane and terrible. I just wanted to point out that contrary to what Hollywood would have us believe, a mandatory phone call after being arrested is not actually a thing or a right at all in any way shape or form.
Not_A_Greenhouse, Haha. welcome to best of reddit. 

Edit: holy shit this got 77000 views in one day
hulivar, hm...I thought this is how prison/jail was?  

I live in Arizona though and we have the infamous sheriff Joe...so maybe these are just the worst of the worst?  When I went to jail for something totally stupid/victimless crime, just like this guy I had to wait in a cell with 30 people for about 24 hours...during that time they move you from cell to cell a few times...

Around you there are tons of empty cells so god knows why they do this.  Sheriff Joe actually takes pride in treating us like shit because we are filthy criminals.  He takes pride in the fact that it costs more to feed the jail/police dogs than it does to feed the prisoners.

So ya, what are jails supposed to be like?

I thought they pulled this shit all the time just because they can and as a prisoner you can't do jack shit about it and for the most part, you are just glad to be the fuck out of there...

What's funny is they let you bring in prescriptions and they don't even check them.  

They focus so much energy on treating us like shit, but they put no work into things like monitoring medications.

If you ever want a potential fat payday, bring in some meds that aren't prescribed to you and then pretend to O.D. or some shit, assuming they let you take them without calling your doctor or whatever
benwin88, My 80+ year old grandmother was Miss Hinds County. I'll let her know about the problem and see if she can do anything about it. 
common_s3nse, Houston jails are a joke too.  
They arrest you for no reason, then they wont tell you about any bail.  
If you beg a guard they may look up your bail and let you know, but then they wont let you pay it.  
You just have to stay in there until someone feels like letting you out.  

The worst part is 75% of the people in the holding cell are there for owing money like for traffic tickets.  It is truly debtors prisons.  

I have a strong feeling these kinds of jails are private and they get free money from the state every day you are in there so it is in their best interest to kidnap you and never let you leave as it makes them lots of money.     

I saw this first hand when I was kidnapped by a houston police officer and taken to houston jail for phoney public intox charges with no evidence.  The whole situation was one big joke and there is nothing I can do to retaliate against the officer. I cant even get him fired for kidnapping me with fake charges.    
He gets to keep his job and gets to keep kidnapping others with fake charges so the jail can make more money.  
I went to trial and cop was there.  He left the court right before my case because I had a lawyer.  He was too much of  a lying asshole to take shit from a lawyer as he knew he was just going to lie on the stand.  
None, Why were you in detention?

djetaine, Sounds exactly like Lew Sterrett in Dallas. I just assumed all county jails were like that. 
Rawtothedawg, I'm from Southaven, and I went to school in Starkville. I can attest to this as I traveled all over MS and saw a lot of the state. I wish I could take in being from there, but it's whenever the majority of the state is like this in every single occupation. 
Sertg, The worst part is, Hinds county (mostly Jackson) has one of the highest crime rates... Other than around Jones county where i live and Wayne county. You'd think they could take a hint to get their act together
drdrizzy13, was in jail in Covington, Louisiana before they make you wait in the holding cell with like 30 people sleeping on concrete floors using your shoes as a pillow....  It could take over a month before you got put into the back to the pods.

doughboy011, Have you tried talking to a lawyer?
Rubieroo, Granted, one doesn't want jail to be pleasant - but if a person is sentenced to incarceration (not death), and instead is actually killed by prison conditions...that's a terrible injustice. 
thebeardsman, Probally because most of the sheriff's department and jail staff are fat fucks and this is coming from someone who lives near hinds and is pretty chubby.

Take a look at a [latin american](http://www.deathvalleymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/3rd-world-jail1.jpg) jail sometime if you want to see inhuman conditions.

You sound bitter and spiteful.  It doesn't add credence to your claims.

ad_me_i_am_blok, How about not being a dumbass criminal in the first place, and you won't end up in jail.

Not saying therse guys should be  sent to prison, but the state attorney is right in saying it's the defense's job to get these evaluations completed as it is the defense of the case. I wouldn't be surprised if the state ordered DAs are stalling cuz they know it's a lost case and just trying to get as much easy time in jail instead of prison as possible. Other than that fully back this post, all jails I've been in have been inhumane.

Edit 2: 34 downvotes, zero replies. I'm glad to see the Reddit hivemind working at full efficiency to punish the heretic. Did I mention that the whole thing where black people give other black people a pass for mistreating black people only works if everyone involved is a Democrat?
drivenlikeahab, I was arrested and taken to jail, based on false claims and spent a wonderful day in the Harris County Jail.  I'm a professional and had taken care of a few of the cops so I got a little better treatment and things were hurried along, but it was basically as it was described earlier, save for the beating of a juvenile, did not witness anything like that, thankfully.  I was treated pretty poorly, as was everyone there.  Food was thrown at me cells were over crowded and worse there was never any info on the progression of things.  I was accused of assaulting my then GF at the time, and all it took was a call from her, some BS photos and I got arrested at work.  I pushed for a trial and the charges were ultimately dropped.  The entire time I was in jail I thought I haven't been convicted of anything, why the hell should I be treated like this, and I was getting preferential treatment.  In smaller towns, not speaking the language, being not-white I can only imagine how bad it can be.  It can happen to anyone, it doesn't take much more than someone with a grudge and a phone, especially in Texas.
Beehead, If even a fraction of this is true for *God's sake* talk to your local media. That's just horrible.

The family of the 14 year old girl who was beaten should sue. Something tells me they were getting off on doing that. A 14 year old female is a threat to a group of guards? Sure.
paintballboi07, I recently spent 3 months in Harris County as terms of my probation. It's ridiculous how subhuman they make you feel in that place. 

The entire 3 months, I never stepped one foot outside. Those nice rec yards you see on TV? The only type of activity we were allowed to do is an hour of walking around inside a gymnasium with a basketball backboard with no rim and a torn up volleyball net. Keep in mind, some people sit in this jail for over a year waiting on their trial date. These are technically "innocent" people that have yet to be accused guilty.

The food is horrible. I'd say the best meal we were served was a chicken patty (I guess it was chicken) with two pieces of bread, usually some white rice or flavor-less beans, and some type of Little Debbies snack. This was the **best** meal we were served. Commissary was once a week, but you're constantly being moved from pod to pod and if you miss your floor's day that week, you have to wait until the next week. This also includes toiletry items such as toothpaste and deodorant. I missed two weeks of commissary when I was there due to being moved multiple times. I had to borrow these items from other inmates, which usually comes with a cost unless you can find someone from your race who's willing to help you out. The commissary items are also **extremely** overpriced. [Here's an example of the prices from 2009, I couldn't find anything newer, but prices have basically doubled since then.](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v327/goopkat/CCF05312009_00000.jpg)

Everyone is treated like animals. If you have any sort of request, you have to fill out a form and wait nearly a week for an answer. Need to go to the clinic? Fill out a form. Want to receive a book from your family/friends? Fill out a form. Want to know you're release date? Fill out a form. If you're actually sick and need to see a nurse within a timely manner, good luck.

Now as for the booking process, I have to say they have slightly improved that since the first time I was in. Granted, it's still takes over 24 hours, but there's no longer holding cells meant for 24 people overloaded with 50-70 people. You are allowed to use the phone for free during the booking process, but there are only 2 phones in each holding tank of 24 people and these phones have no receiver. You just put your ear up to the box and talk into some small microphone holes. It's pretty disgusting when you think about it.

It just really doesn't seem fair that these jails we throw supposedly innocent people into are so inhumane. I think that before the internet age, stuff like this just went under the radar because the only time you heard of these horrible conditions was by word of mouth. Now that anyone can share their experience online, hopefully people will realize what's going on in these county jails.
tadjack, that's only marginally better than Henderson Co. Jail in Athens, Tx.

culopablo, I've been locked up in quite a few jails, and Harris County is the worst one I've ever been to. Fuck that place.
Ghadis, >I always wondered how that jail got away with these very inhumane conditions.

It's because the people there are criminals.  When you step over that line, any decency you get is by the grace of the decent people of the world.  I certainly wouldn't lift a finger to help most people in jail in the US.  A lot of them, I wouldn't piss on them to put them out if they were on fire.
YourADaisyIfYouDo, You are the exception I have been so desperate to see. Reddit hates LEO's and in all honesty there is good reason for it. But men and women like you, who understand that being a law officer or a peace officer is about moral right not legal right are what this nation needs desperately. I hope good things come your way and I hope that if you have children or a family that they carry on and learn from you. 

Thank you. 
Scarlettjax, You are absolutely right.  Now, just to convince the part of corrections that gives the rest of us such a bad name.  A whole lot of it has to do with the leadership, and the kind of behavior they tolerate from their employees.
None, great post!


it seems our society (thanks to a confluence of interests among our corporate elites who are profiting from this) has a huge collective amnesia about the notion (not too distant in our past) that prisons could be rehabilitative rather than punitive. 

of course, this was mixed up with the crazy idea that people weren't inherently 'bad' and that crime was often a product of environment as much as opportunity (people of an upper-middle class background are more likely to commit, say, crimes such as embezzlement (white collar e.g.) than the more 'pedestrian' crimes of armed robbery and b&e) - of course it's not a new notion that criminal behavior is somehow inherent in the "lower" classes' genetic pool or something

there's this hugely false narrative that has been pushed by politicians who are eager to seize a safe issue, ie, 'get tough on crime' (who is going to come out as being "pro" crime? lol), but this country has *never* been "soft" on crime - nosirree - not a nation that invented lynching rustlers and union organizers lol

Besides that, the way we operate our prisons and jails is not with any intention or purpose of reforming or even effective punishment, we breed resentment and suffering that feeds our prison industrial complex by way of our addiction to crime and drugs; it is, for all intents and purposes, the replacement of the system of slavery that made people wealthy through exploitation by means more the same than not. 

You will never solve and it is not a goal of any effort to solve something that it is inherently dependent on not solving.
knickerbockers, Dehumanized? Possibly. Desensitized is probably a better word. A huge chunk of those in jail are going to have an issue of some kind that they want addressed. But an inmate has virtually no recourse for poor treatment by jail staff, as they (and the general public) have virtually no sway over those with the keys. Regardless of whether or not the issue needs addressing, it's just another chore to the CO. You can be damn sure no inmate is going to be able tip a guard for running their paperwork over to processing a day early, even though it's just a five minute walk. They're "just doing their job." In many ways, COs are there to serve inmates, but they draw paychecks from the state, not the jail population. 
leksi_wit, Whatever happened to the idea that perhaps we should rehabilitate as well? ... And there are people who are "found" guilty only to be exonerated years later thanks to DNA or new evidence. Shouldn't we treat all people humanely? How about non-violent crimes? Our for-profit prison system is vastly inhumane. I don't even know where to begin, it's such a humungous problem in American society today. Someone suggested giving felons their right to vote back. I couldn't agree more that is an excellent starting point. 
dualrollers, Correct me if I'm wrong, but jail is not supposed to be a "good experience"... it's punishment.
Ghadis, What were they supposed to do, daintily clean him with baby wipes?

These are corrections personnel, not new age therapy facilitators.
Astilaroth, Ooh! Have you read 'birth of a prison' by Foucault? You'll love it.
None, perhaps not but being charged within 72 hours is definitely a thing and if, as the OP has indicated, people are being left to rot in a holding cell for up to three weeks (unless you've waived your right to an expeditious trial), is definitely a violation of ones' constitutional rights.

just sayin'

AlaricTheBald, Over here in Europe prisons are used for rehabilitation more than punishment, so if anything like this emerged here you can bet there'd be a witch-hunt until everyone involved had been tried. I'm told Scandinavia is even better about their prisons, and also has some of the lowest reoffending rates in the world. Seems a pretty clear cause and effect there.
drlala, I have no idea why he is re-elected over and over again.  If you haven't read any of Shaun Attwood's book I highly recommend it, he has an amazing story.
slapdashbr, Sheriff Joe as you call him is a criminal, an embarrassment to Arizona and the United States, and if I had the opportunity I'd shoot him on sight.

Enthused_Llama, Treating someone like a criminal before they're convicted. Yep, sounds like Arizona.
theslowwonder, This is an interesting comment. Do you mean letter to the editor or does she have friends in the county government?
None, Yes the Harris County jail in Houston Texas is privatized.  This happened back in 2011 I believe it made a blip in the news and folks were not happy about it.  The jail cops come from a corrections company.
rex1030, He is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Your question is actually irrelevant.
GaijinSama, Most likely he's spoken to a few along the way.
None, You're aware that there is a difference between jail and prison, right? Jail is a holding tank for anyone who is arrested. Prison is a holding tank for those who are convicted. It's very far from a 1:1 ratio between those two. 

Even if you believe prison should be a punishment facility, jail should just be a boring room with adequate facilities (restroom, food & drink) that you're prevented from leaving without posting bail. Not some over-crowded filth pit where you are assaulted by guards, denied basic amenities, and humiliated. That's how the 3rd world does it, not the United States.
firedogrob, It is fault of the churches supporting republicanism that are causing the jail to have deplorable conditions? How did you come to that conclusion?
RandomName13, You are a dumb human. 
None, wait... so you would prefer a monarchy? you realize churches tend to support monarchies over republicanism, right?
Korberos, klol
WeAreAllYellow, Regardless of how he got in the system, he's still a person and still has rights.
Astilaroth, Prisons should be about rehabilitation, not vengeance. Look at other countries, such as in Northern Europe. It works. And all the elderly/sick/poor folks will be better off in a society with rehabilitated ex-criminals than one with overflowing prisons and/or completely institutionalised people who served their time.
FrankTank3, Assuming that guy is true, he has REASON to be bitter and spiteful.  
popnwave, Bzzt, not the case in all circumstances. You can be one unlucky dude and get hauled to jail for any number of reasons depending on where you live. 

The system is broken if you fuck over everyone, including innocent folks just in an effort to keep people behind bars.
real-again, I think most citizens would care if they knew the full story. Fact is, the line between a free citizen and criminal is very blurred, and getting worse. 
guy15s, People care a lot more than you think. They just don't care enough to fight a multi-million dollar industry that basically runs whatever neighboring economy comes around.
woodjt5, This view disgusts me. You know nothing about those people or how they got there.
Haulage, Even ignoring every other factor, just take a look at that dumb failure of logic in the last point. "You think this is inhumane? I bet I can think of at least one thing that's MORE inhumane, therefore your point is invalid and I win. Lalala, winning is the best, hooray for being stupid and not having to think about things."
woodjt5, People lie in court, and then innocent people have their lives ruined when people treat them like this. 
rex1030, Not everyone accused of a sex related crime is guilty. However, continue in your ignorance and loud propagation of it.
MonitoredCitizen, I recommend you read this:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal

Not taking part in criminal activities may not help you, your son, or your daughter stay out of jail, man_bear_pig08.
Sewer_Ice, Yet another person that doesn't know in many jurisdictions (re: all of Texas) you can be jailed for moving violations if the officer chooses to do so, also you can be jailed when you're innocent.  Ever hear the expression, "you can beat the time, but you can't beat the ride."

I once nearly found myself in jail for something NOT illegal (I have a CHL and the officer claimed it was illegal for me to have my firearm in my car in that parking lot), sure I would have won on court, but if I was thrown into a jail where I would wait A WEEK before I can contact my attorney (which I keep on retainer) or see a judge, what would have happened to my life?  I would have lost my job, for sure, I would also likely have to drop out of school for that semester because of exams I missed (being falsely arrested and detained is not an "excuses absence" where make-ups would be allowed.).  

These are civil rights abuses, if you value freedom, shut your damn mouth.
real-again, That is a very naive and simplistic outlook, unfortunately. "Criminal activities" encompasses things ordinary people do every day. Plus, they don't have to prove anything to arrest you, prosecutors & judges have their own agendas and are not held accountable for false accusation or sentencing, and the laws are sufficiently vague to enable charges & sentencing of people who had no idea of any wrongdoing. 
PurpleWeasel, The guy describing his experience at the top of the page was still pre-trial. He hadn't been convicted of anything yet. He might well have been innocent.

If your pissy neighbor picked up the phone today, called the cops, and told them that you mugged him, you would be in that cell, and according to the above it might take you as long as a week to even see a judge just to *say* that you didn't do it. Getting the judge to believe you would take a lot longer.
jquest23, ah because criminal activity by the jail staff is ok .. cause you broke the law . .and two wrongs make it right >? right ? 
nernst79, When the police WANT to put you in jail(and almost all of them do now), you'd be surprised what can be trumped up to constitute a 'crime' so that they can get you into the system.  Don't be naive.
Obama_Must_Poop, I've toured prisons in Peru and Bolivia; they put US jails to shame.
Most of Western Europe has humane jails and prisons, and they rehabilitate their criminals, unlike here.

You are an ass.
caxica, because people are never arrested for the wrong reasons, and people lose their rights after being arrested...

right

>literally any other country

"literally" half of Europe is light years ahead of the US in humane treatment of prisoners and... lo and behold!, their recidivism is much lower as a result. 

real-again, Reality check - it's not "us on the outside" and "the scumbags in prison."   #1 - They are people.   #2 - It is WAY easier to find yourself or a loved one on the other side of the bars than you might think. #3 - It DOESN'T MATTER if you are guilty or not; that does not determine whether you are arrested or charged with anything.  #4 - Do you even know what it is really like in these pissant jails? It's not an isolated problem in one jail. Vastly untrained, unqualified people in positions of power, prisoners literally fed bread & water for years, prisoners being sexually assaulted, murdered, and dying from medical causes. Not to mention the laughable justice system shuffling these people around for years. 

tomcat46, Well thats just asinine
None, Th US is incredibly backwards when it comes to jails and prisons compared to every other western country and even many 2nd/3rd world ones. Some countries wont even extradite prisoners to the US because our inhumane treatment of prisoners conflicts with their human rights laws
drice89, American here - got arrested in the Netherlands for drunk and disorderly (tried to run away from a cab driver with out paying like an idiot). They had a nice bed for me to sleep on, video games in my cell, and brought a nurse in to check on me every couple of hours. In the US I got sent to the drunk tank, received no water, and had to share a concrete slab with 3 other people.
svtr, i'll take the entire continent of europe over the US if you ask me that way.
Actually, I'll even take china, at least they give you a bullet to the head instead of experimental drug cocktails.
AndrewKennedy, What a worthless post. We're not talking other countries, were talking about THE ONE WE LIVE IN and the rights due to the citizens OF THE COUNTRY WE LIVE IN. Do you know people who've gotten arrested for no reason And then quickly realeased? I Sure do. That wouldn't happen in this particular jail, which is why we're talking about it in the first place. Because rights and shit.

None, [removed]
polnerac, Could these prisoners have had their cases dismissed? I didn't notice in the article whether they waived their right.
None, No, I'm not implying that.  I'm sure that's true, and that is a miscarriage of justice that needs to be remedied asap.  If they can't get them to trial in the next 30 days, let them out.  I do, however, doubt that the poster above is qualified to say whether the people running the jails and courts are qualified.  I also doubt that information he got in jail about a recent riot is entirely accurate.  Four people were killed in the riot instead of the one that was reported?  Okay.  Maybe that's true.  How does he know that?  He didn't say.  

Also, it's not uncommon for people to be "stuck" in jail for a day or two or even longer after being released by the judge.  One of my closest friends is a defense attorney, and I've heard nightmare stories of what she encounters while trying to get her clients released.  It does depend a lot on how competent the staff is.  I'm not saying it's right, but it's not unique to that one county.  
walterscottmartin, I absolutely agree.  Everyone deserves the right to defend themselves. 
HuellsRulez, As someone that is currently in law school, this is a very effective email.

DocGonzo420, At first I thought you were talking about the all girls dormitory at the University of Alabama that goes by the same name... While those conditions are, well, less than favorable, here is the [Tutwiler Prison for Women.](http://www.doc.state.al.us/facility.aspx?loc=5)
None, He relates this for potential health care abuses while in custody, such as being denied medication, being denied hospitalization, or any other kind of medical care.
DougDante, Thank you for your kind words.
lego306, Mine just sent an auto-reply stating that they will not be taking complaints by email starting may 16th. Coincidence? I THINK NOT!
None, Actually many inmates prefer prison to jail time. Prisons generally provide some sort of shit to do like taking classes, doing a job, learning a skill, and rec equipment. Most jails don't provide hardly anything to do. You just sit there and do jack shit as time moves by painfully slow. Many prisons let you buy a small TV to watch, but in jails it's very rare to be able to watch your own TV. 

I've never been to prison, but I've been to four different jails and spent about a year total at them. Most people who have long sentences can't wait to get sent to prison because jail is so fucking boring. The exception is if you're a child molester or look like a child molester, at which point you don't want to go to prison. 
lego306, It wouldn't matter if you were black or white, THIS SHIT IS UNACCEPTABLE!! Also what does Obama have to do with this?
counterpoint: nazis (white people treat white people badly while white people stand around. until some white (+black) people got pissed off that they were getting beaten and did something!)
byleth, Yes, and the thing is *nobody cares*.  Any politician that lobbies for more humane prisons will just be viewed as being "soft on crime".
anon22342342, jesus christ how horrifying 
FantaTower, You are calling people "criminals" who haven't even been convicted of a crime.  
Astilaroth, You're not a criminal when you're arrested, you are a criminal after a judge/jury convicts you. Also, people make bad choices, do fucked up things. When you stop believing in the good of other people however, you will never be able to contribute anything yourself to a better society. You act like prison is all about vengeance. It should be about rehabilitation, like it is in many countries.
Afchris, So...here is the problem with your attitude. Criminal is broad, very broad. Are we talking about someone robbing a store a knife point or raping their children? The person who robbed a store at knife point will be out in a few years. Now ask yourself, if you have been tortured, beaten up, humiliated, and shit on for so many years, how exactly are you going to feel when you get out? We joke about prison rape but remember that rape destroys you. Humiliation, for years on end, changes a person. Is this for the better? Do we send people to prison so that they may be tortured, so that we can feel better about hurting them? Or do we send them to prison to learn from their mistakes, to gain the ability to function in a society? If the answer is that we want them to be better citizens when they get out then you are going to have to explain how the things mentioned in the post above make someone a better person. Please explain how someone who has anger problems will be made better by having to sit in period blood and eat sandwiches that have been in vomit. Please explain to me how someone with a drug problem can be mercilessly beaten and not desire their drug of choice even more.

If shitty prisons reduced the crime rate then America would have the lowest crime rate in the developed world. However, we don't see that do we? Recidivism in the US is fucking high, like 60 percent and higher (Wikipedia). Now I get that people get all emotional and shit when they talk about crime, but I fail to understand why the label "criminal" makes someone subhuman. But I do think that thinking of people as subhuman can NEVER be beneficial for the person thinking it or the person being though of.
JonnyBravoII, You realize that being arrested for a crime is not the same as being convicted of a crime?  The Bill of Rights even states that all people are innocent until proven guilty.  

P. S. in one of your other posts you mention smoking weed which in most states, is still illegal.  Should you end up in jail for said activity, please make sure you drop me a message so I can send you a sandwich.  
timf3d, This person right here is the reason. Many people have this attitude because they have no sense of morality or compassion, and they are completely oblivious of how things work in the real world. They think people in jail "must be there for a good reason". They've been lucky enough to never have had a loved one in jail. And they won't change their minds until it is too late.

Fortunately we live in a country of law so we don't have to depend on people like this for society to function. Now all we need is someone to enforce the law against the officers who run this jail.
The_Capulet, It's clear that you aren't a part of that group of decent people.  So the only remaining conclusion is that you're a terrible person who holds yourself above other terrible people because there are no consequences on the internet.  Congratulations on being a worthless human being. 
Beehead, > When you step over that line, any decency you get is by the grace of the decent people of the world.

No, actually, in America "cruel and unusual punishment" is against our Eighth Amendment rights.
jquest23, wow, everyday Im reminded im not sc@m like you :) Cheers Naive Sc)m bag 
None, Ummm... I don't know if your just naive or really think people deserve to be treated in such a manner.  You do realize the majority of people who get put into a jail or holding cell are usually there for minor misdemeanor charges.  In fact they are usually pretty decent people who get caught up in the system.  9 times of of 10 they really shouldn't be in jail to begin with.  My stint was short and was due to a low grade misdemeanor charge where I agreed to do a day and a half jail time plus a fine.  I am not some big bad criminal, like you seem to think I should be because of having been in a jail.  I am a mother of two, educated, and that was in fact my very first offense, and I was told I shouldn't have had to be in there in the first place.  I had a chance to talk to some of the women who were there with me and they were mothers from the suburbs, and none of them would qualify as a criminal in my book.  Again, I think that if you dehumanize people in such a fashion then that speaks more about you and your dark side than it does of those who end up in such conditions. No one deserves such treatment and certainly not while they are awaiting trial or defense.  Our penal system is set up against those who are poor or who have no money.  Without money you have no voice or real defense.  
None, i used to hate LEOs and i still don't have much love for them at all (none really) but as i got older i realized that it's just like auschwitz - some of the guards were bastards, some of them were 'just doing their jobs' and some hated the system they were trapped in by a combination of economic need and familial obligations (that's how they get most of us, innit?) and tried to alleviate as much as they could the harshest conditions and never went out of their way to harm or abuse the prisoners 

tl/dr: hate the game not the playa lol
None, Yes I forgot to add, cell phone calls didn't work. Also if it went to voicemail, that didn't work. For some reason my brother's cell phone number, which I only remembered because I borrowed it when he traveled for a few months, worked.. and he happened to answer it at 6am on a Sunday. 

I only knew one land line number and nobody answered. My arraignment was scheduled for 3 days later. When I got hold of a lawyer he told me it was unusual that I was even booked into jail at all, and that I probably was because I pissed off the officers by remaining silent the entire time in custody (like, awkwardly silent.. I just did not speak). 
urbanek2525, No, he's acting like Joe Citizen who got arrested. Getting arrested doesn't mean you necessarily did anything wrong. A police officer got a bug up his/her butt and arrested you. That's all. There should be no concept of punishment attached to being arrested and the process of being arrested and released (awaiting trial) should not constitute a punishment of any sort. At that point, you are being accused, and are presumed innocent of the accusation.
bmoc, Or maybe, just maybe... your father is part of the incompetence he described.
Marsftw, What? Your dad too much of a lazy fat fuck to be a proper cop? 

Go away. 
None, Your dad's probably a cunt, as well. 
streetbum, ...
None, In almost every state, felons *do* get their right to vote back. That doesn't stop people from lying to you about it, though. In my case, some bitter cunt in the fringes of the judicial system.

None, [deleted]
olemiss1, County jail is for pre-trial detainees. These are people that have been arrested, but not yet tried or convicted. I would agree with your point as to a state correctional facility, but a county jail is used for detention, rather than punishment.
xX_CorpusDei_Xx, Have you ever been to jail? Im not the smartest guy in the world but if you treat people like animals they will act like animals. In no way does treating a man like a wild animal help him integrate with society. It should also be known that MS has a high repeat offender rate. I wonder why... 
specsishere, Probably not beat him.
DrSlightlyLessDoom, Yes actually. 

swingafrique, don't know details about scandinavia, but as a former humanitarian aid worker in a central european prison, i can absolutely not confirm your statement. rape, dissease, oppression and abuse by the guards etc occure in every prison. i would call it the norm, not the exception. i've both witnessed and heard of countless hunger strikes, self inflicted wounds and (attempted) suicide by people going crazy cause of the conditions they are forced to live in. 

prison guards will often be former street police, whose behaviour was too bad to be seen in public (rudes, alcoholics, psychos). as a kind of internal punishment they will be sent to prison, as guards. 

there are no witch hunts. just recently, in austria, there was this case of a 16 year old prisoner getting raped by other prisoners. they didn't have space in the minors prison, so authorities put him in the cell with adults. consequenses for the involved staff? none. the rapists though were sentenced to spend even more time in prison... 

on your "pretty clear cause and effect": i'd be interested to see some sources on "lowest reoffending rate" produced by scandinavian prisons. i think you are referring to a justice system that tries to avoid putting people in prison by using alternative means of punishment (social work, house arrest, ...). many studies indicate that a prison sentence usually destroys peoples chances of ever getting back to a "normal" life. 

there are definitely differences between US and european prison system, but they are not that much of humanitarian nature. IMO one of the main differences is the economic exploitation of prisoners in US, which has reached dimensions european law-and-order politicians can only dream of. 

tl;dr: there is no such thing as a humane prison. 
cweaver, Just to clarify - they're not even talking about prisons here (the place you go once you've been convicted of a crime and sentenced).  They're talking about 'jail' - which is just the place you go after you've been arrested and you're waiting for a trial.
drlala, Shooting would not be painful enough.
joyous_genitals, > inb4 FBI van  
  
Its Sheriff Joe. Federal government is probably on your side for once.
theslowwonder, There's no end of hate I have for this guy; having spent about 7 years in Phoenix. He's an incredibly savvy newshound, and has basically the perfect disguise. He named himself "the toughest sheriff in the country", which has been a brilliant way of posturing himself. So, anytime anyone complains that he's inhumane, most people just hear that he's tough on crime. 

It was frustrating to me that the anti-Arpaio groups chose not to focus on incompetence and instead focused on his cruelty. Though humanitarian violations are more disturbing, this doesn't erode his base as effectively as it could. 
common_s3nse, That makes perfect sense to why they refuse to tell you your bail and refuse to let you bail out.  
They make money by keeping you in there.  It is a scam.  

The one thing I hate about texas is the states hard-on for funneling public tax dollars to private for-profit companies for less bang for our buck because they at least skim 15% off the top for profits.  
None, lol, someone doesn't have a good grasp of the legal system I see.
smorea, In a lot of states inmates with short sentences (often a year or less) may serve out their time in jails rather than prisons.

Regardless, I agree that punitive measures should not occur before sentencing.
hootplate, I'm not that poster, but here's a logical argument; 
The church tells its congregation what is moral.
The church supports Republican ideals.
The church tells its congregation that Republican ideals are moral.
Republicans believe that the poor want to be poor, and that the tough on crime attitude (to include these inhumane jails) works.
The congregation comes to believe in 'tough on crime' and 'bootstraps' ideologies.
The congregation allows and votes for these conditions.
None, Lets see how is that trickle down taxation working for you.

The king of repulicanism family the bush bank collapse, the housing collapse, the DOW collapse, and the 800,000 a month job loses that followed.

All the bush wars for what. 

More terrorist now than then.

Fail over fail over fail.

Yet the money republianism and religion going hand in hand.

Even now Canada has bigger middle class. 

And all the fuck the poor talk has actual consequences.



rkim777, >Regardless of how he got in the system, he's still a person and still has rights.

Yes, he has rights. But avoiding jail would be the easiest way to keep his rights rather than fight an uphill battle for those rights while incarcerated for breaking the law, wouldn't it? Following the law is very easy to do, it's not rocket science.

Ironically, going to jail by breaking the law may have deprived a victim of those very rights that he is trying to restore to those still in jail who also broke the law and did likewise to their victims.
None, I suppose that's right, but give me an example of someone going to prison who didn't at least get NEAR a genuine crime?  Seems like jail is fairly avoidable for 99.6% of the population.

Edit:  lots of downvotes, no examples = lazy Redditors.
None, Getting worse?  The gov spends about $75 billion a year on corrections.  The private prisons are heavily monitored.  Prison labor (where things are made and inmates paid) has INCREASED in last 10 years.  What am I missing?

buttermybars, This needs to be higher. Way too many naive people in here. You don't need to be guilty to be improperly jailed and have your life ruined.
ehtork88, Hear ya man. Went through something similar in Austin for standing on the sidewalk between two parks cars. I was initially respectful, but after the officer approached me again (I non-chalantly had one foot on the curb and one on the street) as I was meeting with people and we were waiting, I got a little annoyed. I then proceeded to mention three cute, blondes blatantly jay-walking to which I was told to "Worry about myself".

Anyways, I was crossing the street later and he drove by and said "Listen to your friends son" to which I (idiotically) said "Would you mind your own damn business, I'm just trying to cross the street". This was a month after I had surgery on my arm (two rods on my radius and ulna) and I had minimal (couldn't even extend my arm) movement. He tried to throw my arm behind my back and when it physically wouldn't go, he thought I was resisting and threw me on the ground-- my arm, though, was incapable of being put behind my back because of my surgery. 

Later, after my court case was settled, I read his testimony. He wrote that I "pushed him with both hands on his chest" even though I had my back to him and only had one functional arm. Makes my blood boil, but it gave me a totally different view of how things work. I'm ashamed to admit that I had the tough-on-crime attitude, but it clearly stemmed from ignorance rather than reasonable logic. 
MeEvilBob, >These are civil rights abuses, if you value freedom, shut your damn mouth. 

Wouldn't it make more sense to never shut your damn mouth until as many people know about this as possible?  People being silent is how the problem got as bad as it did.
caxica, im not a lawyer or nothing but I'm pretty sure you would have a case against your employer and school if they fired/failed you for being in jail, especially if your civil rights were violated

CallMeSugarbritches, If you are insinuating that people who do not commit crimes are under serious threat of being incarcerated due to "trumped up" charges then you are the one who is naive, and ignorant. Wrongful convictions are incredibly rare in the U.S. Justice system. In [this article](http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/21/more-than-2000-wrongfully-convicted-people-exonerated-in-23-years-researchers-say/), which is actually also attempting to make your ridiculous point, the innocence project details how approximately 2,000 people had their convictions overturned since 1989. Compared to the roughly 14 million people who were arrested each year during that time until now that results in about 1 in every 750,000 arrests being eventually found unlawful during that time. Its very unfortunate that a few people have been subjected to, as you so eloquently put it, "trumped up" charges. But it is pretty obvious that it is an incredibly rare occurrence. I suggest you find a new boogeyman to replace the "crooked cops" you seem to think are everywhere, the hood rats out on the stoop have been complaining about these alleged evil doers for decades and its getting really old.
popnwave, He's been watching too much "Locked Up Abroad".
sporealy606, You should probably find some better tours.
sporealy606, I've yet to come in contact with someone who's been arrested without any guilt on their own part or any association to guilt.  While I do feel for anyone that is falsely accused of a crime, it seems to me this thread is more for people that are just complaining because they got caught.
aslate, As soon as we can group them together as "them" we can dehumanise them. We don't think in terms of the poor person dealing weed to make ends meet, feed his family or have any kind of moral reason to justify their actions (albeit it's still a crime). Instead we can say "they" shouldn't have done it, and therefore "they" are responsible for where they are and "we" owe them nothing in the form of fair treatment in society. "we" don't owe them a chance to rehabilitate, "we" shouldn't spend "our" resources on helping them. 

So many arguments are cast as black and white, us vs. them, tight vs.  wrong. Suddenly we can't talk about the deserving poor and destitute, but have to talk about the worst of the worst, those that really don't deserve a second chance, then we can extrapolate... 
sporealy606, So the novel idea of not committing a crime and complaining about prisons is asinine?  Ok, I'm the crazy one here.
sporealy606, So I assume the getting arrested for no reason probably means, to you, they were drunk or in a fight and got picked up for drunk and disorderly or something similar.  While I'm sure the people you know may have been locked up for something you feel they should not have been locked up for, that does not mean they were innocent.  Sure, this facility needs to work on their processes, but to complain about jail being rough is something I'll never understand.  As someone that got arrested a handful of times in my early 20's, I did come in contact with corrupt and less than competent law enforcement, but instead of complaining about how hard it was, I just decided to stop doing stupid stuff that will land me in jail.

mikitronz, They can of course copy whoever they want but a) you have to first and at a minimum send it to the state level corrections health office, and b) if you're just cc'ing folks on a whim you are communicating that you don't know the system well enough to threaten folks into quick action.

devilbunny, It can be unacceptable all day long - but my downvotes speak for themselves. People clearly object to my pointing out the fact that nothing is going to happen for political reasons. I assume it's because they are partisans who can't stand someone pointing out an uncomfortable fact. I'd welcome being corrected, but as of this writing it's 37 downvotes and only your reply.

The Democratic Party, as a general rule, is very concerned about white people abusing black people, and very unconcerned about black people abusing black people. The Obama administration is not going to go open a civil rights case in the South that ends up accusing *black* people of violating other black people's civil rights, because that doesn't get people angry and doesn't get them to the polls - not least because it tramples on the locals who actually run the get-out-the-vote operations.

It's sad, because it's sort of a Nixon-to-China thing. Republicans who tried to do something about it would be burned at the stake for racists if they attempted to fix this; at least a black Attorney General to a black President could do something about it. They won't, though.
Ghadis, > You act like prison is all about vengeance. 

No, it's about not caring one way or another.

>It should be about rehabilitation

Is money better spent on criminals or on the poor, the hungry and the aged?  I am not my brother's keeper.  Most of the people in there are rather distant relatives.

I do agree that this sort of thing in a holding tank is pretty outrageous.
shopcat, This message will self destruct. 
Ghadis, Naive?  That's hilarious.  I'm so cynical that I don't give a flying fuck what happens to anybody I don't know, much less criminals.  I think they should be put in labor camps and the money taken and given to the innocent people they harmed.
7oby, I've been thinking about starting some service you could pay for (unfortunately most people probably wouldn't think they'd ever need it and wouldn't pay, even if it was a one time fee like buying 'minutes') where we provide a landline number you can easily remember, you set up a list of people to notify and we take care of it for you, and you just call us, give some identifying number (maybe we use YOUR phone number? and you just type it in and we call to verify that you're not answering), and then we call people you had previously specified and relay your message. We can also e-mail.

The problem is, we have to pay people to make these phone calls/e-mails and run the infrastructure, so the issue of keeping it running is a big problem.  But if it's provable that calling cell phones from prison _does not work_, then it could be seen as a cheaper alternative to keeping a landline...

Plus, you could put as many people as you want, maybe after a few there's a fee per line but still.  Your mom, your lawyer, your employer (if you want), your girlfriend, your dad, your grandma, whoever.
mickeysbeer, I guess the phone calls down there work differently then here in Canada or maybe its just Ontario.
Either way it's good you can call cel numbers and stuff. We can't.

I'm hoping a lawyer files a motion eventually challenging that. It sucks we can only call Bell landlines up here.
Ghadis, You're a fucking felon?  Who really has a disgusting personality, prick?

slapdashbr, I can only hope. 

Philosophically, I understand that violence is almost never a good solution. But damn he is one of the few people in the world who makes me so angry I just want to go hulk-mode and smash his face in. 
rex1030, I have a better grasp of how it should work, and how it is broken. "I see" is an obvious contradiction.
ehtork88, I'm apolitical, but live in what one can only call your typical southern town (very, very conservative). Attend various churches regularly, and while I hear a lot of dumbass things-- I've never heard any of what you just said.

I'm sure it's happened-- in fact, I'm positive. But it certainly is not a "majority". 
firedogrob, I find the situation deplorable and all of the responsible parties should be held in the same conditions as punishment. With that being said, I have to disagree with your view that the church, being they are supporting Republicans, believes the poor want to be poor and cruelty is acceptable. I see quite a lot of help being given out to the poor in my neighborhood with furthering education, daycare, clothing, housing, etc. I have not seen as many agnostics (myself included) or atheists (Redditors excluded) that do more for the poor.
None, yeah. I agree... stop calling it republicanism, though. it makes it look like your referring to a republican type of state being bad, not the political party and it's policies
WeAreAllYellow, I agree with you, following laws is easy, and I realize that if there's a victim involved then impeding their rights via crime is shitty.

I'm just saying that there's a lot more to people than just what they've done wrong, and even then we should consider why the crime happened.

popnwave, The odds are on your side, but when some crazy shit goes down, you just hope it's not in a county like this.

I think the majority of people are for justice being served. Hell, I have no issues with the death penalty for certain crimes. The problem is that the system is corrupt and far from being being fair. Because of that I have problems when I hear about places like this here in the US. If you're going to punish folks, it has to be done swiftly and fairly with no differences if you're poor, rich, black, or white. 
subsonik2nine,  Private prisons should not even exist. The very fact that they lobby for more things to be considered crimes alone is enough to prove the system is broken. Prisons are not profit centers.
real-again, What you are missing is the part where private prisons are heavily monitored. So are state & federal prisons, supposedly, and the conditions described in the article are actually common. The increased spending is due to increased incarceration rates. Do you know how much the prisoners are paid? It is laughable, and merely a technicality so they can claim to pay the workers. I have seen no benefit offered to society from increased correctional spending. It all sounds good in theory & on paper, but actual conditions & programs are getting worse. 
yowhatisupdog, Your opinions don't mean shit in the face of the law. Whatever the offense all a guaranteed a fair trail and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. If these freedoms are lifted, even for the most heinous of crimes, then your own rights cease to mean anything. Please possess a level of maturity when dealing with issues as serious as law just not to point at a crowd of people you deem undesirable and scream for their mutilation without due process or any respect for the democratic system.

There is no case against your school or employer, the only person you may have a civil case against to collect damages is those who had you falsely imprisoned, and in the case it was a minor traffic infraction that you are guilty of, you have no recourse.

That's your main problem. Most people know one person smart enough to handle this all for them anyway . . I did, and fortunately I remembered his number and he answered, but truth is I never expected to ever end up in jail. 

All someone needs is to notify someone 'I am in jail you figure out the rest,' which just requires a phone call. The limiting factor here is the jail making that difficult to impossible. 

After a smart person knows you're in jail all that is left is bailing you out.
calsosta, The goal would be a system that allows people to call in, record a short message and have it auto-call friends and family.  Spin it as an emergency contact system.  Additionally you can provide services to lookup and connect with services like Defense attorneys or bail bondsmen.

Easy enough using Node and Twilio.com

Set up a Twilio account.  Set up a MEAN stack.  Create the UI.  Create IVRs and automatically search for Attorneys and Bail bondsmen base on the ANI of the caller ( the jail ).

Create a simple ID/PIN system so the callers can trigger their call list.  At the end of the robo calls automatically offer to connect with an attorney or Bail bondsmen that you found based on the ANI.

Once you start getting some usage, then engage Bail Bondsmen and Attorneys to sell advertising or become the Preferred connection.

Become a hundred-thousand-aire.

ABadManComing, Great idea but your right about maybe you average person not paying for it. However, if the price is nominal enough you can maybe exploit this into viability poor neighborhoods and inner cities. Though, most of those people Ive seen in such locations have "ties" to the street and connections that they wouldnt use it and you'd also have to find a shitty enough Police Department. Not to mention I could see a repeatedly arrested person likely has their favorite bails bondsman do the minimal work extra if info is on file
ellamking, You could do it very simply with an email list, and attach an .mp3 message.  Then it could all be automated: call, which email list (lawer, work, family), record message.  Like a reverse robo-call.  It could be used for other services than jail too.  Out of the country; lost your phone; etc.

None, I'd agree that prisoners get a better wage for their work IF they are making products that can sell at such a cost as to justify a higher wage.

In terms of getting worse, the US has roughly 2.2 million people incarcerated, the main reason for the higher number is longer drug sentences (bad, I agree) but there are 4,500 prisons and I'd pose this question to you: of those, how many are BETTER overall than they were 10-15 years ago.  How many are worse.  I bet 70% are better.

sporealy606, You got it - oh wait, one of the times that I did get arrested was in Ireland, another was in Spain and a third was in Puerto Rico (not bragging, but just using evidence to make my point - admittedly, I was drunk and an idiot each time).  I know that those jails universally came with overcrowded holding cells, very physical officers, varying levels of brown water and expired/moldy food that you'd rather starve than eat.  Hell, a friend and I actually got our asses kicked in Buffalo, NY by cops, and he even filed suit against them for excessive force.  I understand that things can be less than ideal, but in all situations, if I had just decided not to act in a way that I should've known would get me in trouble, I would've been comfortable in my bed that night.  Again, as I've been saying all along, I do feel for people that are wrongfully locked up (or locked up for more "justifiable" crimes/violations), but to say that international jails are resorts compared to what we have in the US, in my experience, that's just not true.
Obama_Must_Poop, Definitely a women's prison in Bolivia. It's still a prison, but not too bad, all things considered.
sporealy606, I love that this liberal conversation has been lined with people calling me an "ass" and a "sadist" just for showing a difference in opinion.  I stopped reading when you resorted to name calling (you do not know me, so that's just unfair).  Until you can discuss the issue without resorting to name calling, I find your points invalid.
sporealy606, Interestingly enough, I do know a group of NASA employees, but your point is lost on me because astronauts never go to space and complain about the lack of oxygen.  Instead, they grin and bear it because, well, they knew what they were getting into when they signed up for it.  Just as people breaking the law should know what they are getting into.
sporealy606, Probably not phrased the best, but I meant more suspicion of guilt.  We're talking about jail here which means someone hasn't been tried (right?), so basically, I'm saying that I personally have no experience with someone getting plucked off the street and arrested for nothing....however, I must be the most ignorant man in the world, because according to some of the impassioned responses I've gotten, this stuff is happening all the time.
sporealy606, If you read my comments, I actually did mention that I was arrested a handful of times in my early 20's, so I do understand the process and I also mentioned that I do feel for those people that are wrongfully accused.  However, the OP didn't mention anything about his charges, or whether or not he/she was innocent or guilty, but still people are quick to their defense.  Those that are locked up wrongfully receive a ton of sympathy from me, but this is a problem that I find to be lower on the totem poll compared to even the issue of wrongful termination from jobs.  My overall point is this:  With every terrible atrocity taking place in our country and in the world, it's hard for me to place importance on this issue.  Instead of complaining about jail conditions, let's talk about real world conditions that land some of these people in situations that they feel justifies the committing of crimes.  IE: Single parent families, job loss, immigration, gang affiliation, etc.
sporealy606, See, but that's where I have trouble taking this thread seriously.  I was responding (initially) to two posts, one which told the story of two men who stabbed and killed people, and a follow up comment from someone who says nothing about why they were arrested.  Everyone opposing my comments fails to acknowledge that I do sympathize for situations in which someone was arrested wrongfully or for a more justifiable crime, but to compare a moving violation to murder is a pretty substantial leap, no?
Mac1822, Usually it comes down to a tactical decision by the lawyer, and the defendant will personally enter his time waiver on the record. 
Typically it goes something like this:

Judge: Counsel does you client waive time?

Defense: Yes, your Honor. 

Judge: Please voir dire your client. 

Defense: Mr. Defendant do you understand you have the right to a speedy trial, within 60 days of your arraignment?

Mr. Defendant: Yes. 

Defense: And do you give up that right?

Mr. Defendant: Yes. 

While it may not be in writing, per se it is on the record and will appear on the court minutes and in the transcript.

The other point about having a favorite bondsman that can take care of it is decent, but they might not be interested in doing it if the bond isn't enough that you'd need them. It's a for profit business, making calls that get you out without earning them more money doesn't make sense.

Scarlettjax, There's a group -unfortunately large- who just gets the biggest thrill from reading about punishment or poor treatment of inmates.

I'm calling bullshit on your claim about being arrested in Ireland if you claim they have overcrowded holding cells and food/water like that. Like the UK, the Irish police stations have a one prisoner per cell policy and very strict policies on prisoner welfare.
Obama_Must_Poop, > but to say that international jails are resorts compared to what we have in the US

Nobody said that. Quit making shit up.

>Try getting arrested in **literally** any other country and then you'll have something to complain about. 

(Emphasis added.)

That is what was said. It's demonstrably false. Bone up on your reading comprehension if you want to speak with the adults.
Kindern, Bull-fucking-shit.

[Europe has a standing policy of one person per cell.](https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=955747) especially when intoxicated and even more specifically when you're in a cell without being charged.
caxica, Would you feel better if I merely described your attitude as sadistic and not you?   I suppose there is a difference but at the moment it seems like hair splitting. I probably should be more charitable to you if I expect you to become charitable to prisoners, but right now I'm not really feeling like sugarcoating anything.  I'm really, really, really fucking sick of your disgusting attitude towards "criminals", again, not just from a mere moral standpoint but because your attitude actively increases the incidence of crime even though you are too blinded by hate to see it. If it makes you feel better I think that even you would deserve due process and humane treatment if you were arrested, regardless of the crime.
caxica, And to be perfectly honest that's a fucking copout.  Take out the "name calling" and I still made a solid point that you are choosing to ignore.  Ad hominem is using an attack instead of an argument, not an attack with an argument.   Here you expect people to just "suck it up" when faced with inhumane conditions in jail, yet you refuse to try to refute my point after getting your feelings hurt.  You deny being a sadist yet your beliefs are undeniably sadistic. You can dish it out but can't take it.


EdwardBalls, You are stupid, bad, sadistic, retarded, and a supreme fucker. Please kill your self.
rockyali, It really depends on what that suspicion is based on, doesn't it? I mean, cops don't arrest people for no reason, but they very frequently arrest people for bad reasons. And don't arrest other people for equally bad reasons. 

If a law is good, it is good if it is perfectly enforced. That is, it would be ideal if 100% of murderers were correctly identified and convicted. Close to 50% of the American public has used illegal drugs. If drug laws were perfectly enforced, most people (50% drug felons, plus X% other felons) would go to prison at some point in their lives. That would be moderately disastrous for the country. Drug laws are bad laws. 

But, they are on the books. And if we lowered the standard from "perfectly" to just fairly enforced, then we would see groups proportionately represented relative to rates of drug crime. And we don't see that at all. So, some factor other than actual guilt or innocence is what causes suspicion. 

SabineLavine, I think you can care about those issues and still work towards better conditions in our jails and prisons.  You simply cannot improve the lives of minorities and poor people without looking at the impact that mass incarceration has had on these families and their communities.  The [school to prison pipeline](https://www.aclu.org/school-prison-pipeline) is a very real thing, and it's only getting worse as the prison industry becomes more and more privatized.

People might not want to face it, but this is something that affects us all.

MikeyDeez, As a social worker (MSW/ASW-G) for a healthcare oversight agency (APS) I can tell you exactly how much a chain letter consisting of an anonymous "redditor's report" would be prioritized.

There are proper channels for these kinds of things, chain emails are not one of them.  I doubt this would make it past a secretary/intern.  Guess what happens when five dozen of these show up in the same inbox within a few hours...*junkmail!*

If people actually care, they put their **name** behind their words and deliver those words through a medium that will at least have a chance at being taken seriously.

Usually this entails more than a few clicks or pokes on an iphone.

I know it's /r/bestof and therefore infallible, but *we* don't even know who "theoffdutyninja21" is.

Just wait till these officials google "reddit" and see what reddit did when we "identified the boston marathon bomber" ...*oh yeah we better act on the word of an anonymous redditor who's bitter about the jail he claims to have just been released from; never heard about somebody hating the place they were imprisoned or lying anonymously on the internet!!!*

Chances are that they'll operate under the assumption that their jobs may be put at more risk by acting on a "report" from a "source" like this received by a bunch of anonymous people than by ignoring it.  There's even someone who doesn't live in the country saying they're sending the email...**why the fuck do you** (not necessarily  *you*) **think you have any business reporting something you have no way of witnessing or verifying?!**

This is just not how the world, correctional system, politics, government, etc... work.

sporealy606, Now, what's exactly hateful and sadistic about me admitting that this facility needs to improve their processes, but instead of complaining, maybe it's better just to avoid situations that will get you arrested?  I even said that I do feel for people that are wrongly accused of crimes.  A majority if you had your arguments locked and loaded, ready to unleash on the first person that didn't agree with you. Now, you're doing that to me with your much more hate filled than anything I've ever said  comments, and you're not even addressing my initial point.  If suggesting that people don't get arrested so they can enjoy freedom is hateful, then I guess common sense is hateful.  But you guys go ahead and keep fighting "hate" with stronger, more blatant and blind hate.  That's cool too.  Meanwhile, I'll keep my focus on trying to be productive member of society.
msm2485, I find your comment very stupid and sadistic.  I wasn't even going to say anything, until I looked at your comment history and found several other instances of you telling people something along the line of "please kill yourself".  Please stop spreading hate.

I don't know if I should miss the blind optimism shown here or feel satisfied with the loss of naievity I've evidently experienced. I can't believe citizens of our country can even remotely feel that this sort of response has a chance of creating an impact. I suppose I should see it as a positive, but it also leads to expending energy in the wrong directions. However, it also  makes you feel like you accomplished something.

It was just the sort of SNAFU that led to me leaving MS.

caxica, "Don't get arrested" is extremely simplistic advice.   It's almost akin to "don't be poor" or "don't get sick" for the conservative takes on poverty and healthcare, respectively.   How about we work to make a society where no one has any real incentive whatsoever to do things that will get them arrested?   Or we could continue our society where lots of people are disenfranchised from society and thus have little reason to obey the law.  The only thing the legal system should work towards is reducing recidivism.  Then again when most of our population has a medieval mentality like yours, systemic change is not easy
EdwardBalls, shut up retard
bmoc, Like your stance on jailtime. Don't be a dumb-ass online if you don't want the conditions that come with it.
MikeyDeez, Full disclosure: I'm under 30.

I suppose the idea that people are taking an interest in things is only a positive, and the visceral reaction to (alleged) human rights violations are a positive sign.  It's nice to see that people care, want to change the situation, and are looking for a way to make an impact.

The naivety/ignorance are "good" problems in that respect.  No positive change could come about if people didn't care; the challenge and next step is channeling those feelings into positive action.

A situation like this isn't solved overnight, or though emails. The desire for change is merely the first step.  If there's a "downside", it would be the amount of people who lose interest or fail to translate their passion into action; that remains to be seen.

We have great powers in media and the internet to spread the message of how change can be accomplished; we just need to educate activists in how their energies are best spent.
MikeyDeez, True; sending a fax is probably the most effective. 
MikeyDeez, And this is my point:

If you want to start an investigation, make allegations that are remotely credible (ie: not an email with the body "anonymous redditor reports"), don't report something you can't witness or verify, and *report it through the proper channels*.


MikeyDeez, And a witty saying proves nothing.  If you're actually suggesting that Edmund Burke (who this quote can't even be legitimately attributed to) thought that getting pissy and firing off an email based on the comment on reddit from a random netizen would hold evil at bay...you need to wake up.

If you saw a crime occurring,  would you consider throwing a message in a bottle into the Atlantic ocean "doing something about it?" **No!** You would call 911 because that's how you report a crime to the authorities in a way that allows them to respond lawfully and properly...how is this any different?

> "The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing."

While copying and pasting an email isn't technically "nothing"; a few clicks here and there while neglecting proper channels for complaints is *barely* something. In fact, it might as well be nothing as an anonymous email citing complaints from an anonymous source -especially given the past missteps of reddit acitvists- is tantamount to suggesting looking up symptoms on webMD is "doing something" about treating cancer.

>  In a truly free and equal country, these claims would be investigated anyway, even if only based on hearsay.

And in a truly equal and free country, this never would have happened.

It's willful ignorance to think that firing off an email to propagate hearsay is "activism".  Again; *there are proper channels, processes, and authorities to report these allegation to and through.  Why you wouldn't take an extra five minutes to do so, or accept that*  **you don't know what the fuck you're talking about when you spread hearsay** is beyond me, if you're suggesting that you truly care about fighting evil.

And lastly: **I don't think that a truly free and equal country would give two shits about what a random redditor comments**. [The friends and family of Sunil Tripathi might agree.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/04/25/boston-bombing-social-media-student-brown-university-reddit/2112309/) They also might not.

A "truly free and equal" society relies on due process and a proper justice system; not anonymous vigilantism and hivemind neckbeard-acitvism.

If you give two shits about these prisoners, learn their names, research the manner of their deaths, verify "theoffdutyninja21"'s identity and claims, and **take the time to lodge an official complaint in a manner in which it can be taken seriously by authorities.** 

*The proper channels and means exist;* pretending they don't and wasting your time with ineffectual emails is actually "doing nothing".

None, After you're done sipping on your white guilt, consider this:  There are thriving Hmong immigrant communities throughout the U.S. Often where little English is spoken but family/education/hard work/community are culturally valued and as a result, they do well in the U.S., so I don't think we can say that anyone doesn't get a fair shake in this nation.  Sure, there are things we could both point to that suggest an upper hand for some, but look at the most successful immigrant populations and it's hard to feel too sorry for the ones that don't progress over a period of decades.  
sporealy606, See it's crazy that we completely agree on so many things, but you pulled such a misunderstood interpretation of my view based on "don't get arrested" - I wholeheartedly agree that we should be approaching the societal issues that land some of the less "criminal" persons in jail.  That's actually my whole point:  It's kind of backwards to blame the jails while completely ignoring the circumstances that landed a person/people in jail.
msm2485, You must be a very miserable person.  
caxica, lmao exactly
sporealy606, Tell me about my position on jail time, please.  You know, since I never have even mentioned sentencing, appropriate jail time, or anything similar to that.  Those are your assumptions.
html6dev, Full disclosure 28 And I agree. The Internet collective definitely has the ability to create change. I just think this idea that sending chain letters is going to solve the problem is so convenient that it has led to a drop off in actual action. Remember a few years ago when anything like this on the Internet would at least spark some local anonymous group to hold some sort of protest? That really slowed in 2013, and is basically dead in the water this year. I think the "send an email" attitude plays into that. The most effective method here would be for the people to really start inciting the locals who can show up at the front door (or get on a bus :))

None, [deleted]
rockyali, Yes, but what are those circumstances?

If any country in the world incarcerated 30% of its population, we would call it a police state. We wouldn't ask what the "criminals" had done wrong, because it would be clear to us that the state was primarily at fault. 

In the US, we incarcerate 1 in 3 black men in their lifetimes. Blacks and whites commit drug crimes of the same types and at the same rates (about 7.3/100). Black men are 12x more likely to be incarcerated for drug crimes than white men. 

Stop and frisk is another thing that is more police state than not. 90% of those stopped were doing nothing wrong. Not guilty nor associated with guilt. Nothing. 
bmoc, He's just lucky we don't lock people away from weeks without representation for base ignorance... yet.

I suppose maybe I see a lot of potential,  but I don't know enough to say whether or not people are lazier :P
MikeyDeez, It's seriously how most day-to-day healthcare and government correspondence is done!
MikeyDeez, *No*body ever said the system is infallible. Otherwise my profession would not exist.  It's well known that abuses and neglect will happen, which is why the state allows for proper grievance actions and litigation.

Redditors are just too quick to assume that their anonymous emails are somehow superior and more effective than (and yes, it *does* take more effort than an email, because it *should) actually going about filing a grievance via the proper mechanisms.

> and that is exactly the problem

*What problem?*  *What doesn't work?* ***What have you tried to pursue via proper channels prior to anonymous emails?***

You're making these assumptions, without actually researching the claims, and aside from researching and verifying the claims, I highly doubt anyone in this thread has *tried* to file a grievance through the proper channels.

Its not that I don't have a positive outlook, I'm just pointing out that sending a hasty email is *not* the right way to do this, and too many people are too quick to assume the proper channels are ineffective, so anonymous emails are the only way to get anything done.

That's just lazy. 

I'm glad you care; I'm just challeniging you and others to care *enough* to try to do things the right way first, even if it takes more effort than a cut&past anonymous email.

**Take my field: Elder Abuse. It happens; it shouldn't because America is the best, but realistically it will, so the state sets aside funding and training to provide oversight agencies. It doesn't mean the system is broken; its so not-broken that there's a self-repair mechanism.**

**The proper way to report suspected abuse/neglect/exploitation is via the state hotline or a call to my agency. If everyone just emailed random officials that grandma was getting beaten, I'd never get a chance to do my job. It's not that my job doesn't exist, or is ineffective, its just that in order to do my job, someone needs to care enough to properly report an offence.**

I understand change doesn't happen overnight but at what point does the slave history cease to be an excuse for modern day bad behavior?  3 years from now?  20 years from now? 50? Never?

sporealy606, Yikes - I'm not getting into arrest stats by race, I probably should get some work done this afternoon, LOL.  However, I do agree with what you're saying here, and this is what should be talked about rather than the treatment of prisoners in one jail.  Let's keep the wrong people out of jails then, most of these other problems (overcrowding, understaffed, etc), should begin to fix themselves (I know, that's a utopian stance, but I think it's a better approach than focusing on prisoners rights because, as one person said earlier, the majority of the US population doesn't find that specific issue very important).
caxica, lol if we did that then pretty much everyone would spend most of their lives in jail 

sporealy606, The inclusion of the word yet kind of makes you worse than anyone you're trying to fight against?  "Yes, I'll stick up for the rights of criminals in general ignoring every detail about what landed them in there, but if I think you're ignorant, well that's what we want to lock people up for"  Sounds a lot like the thought police to me.

rockyali, Lol, well, I will leave you be. But you can't talk about criminal justice in the US without talking about race and class. As an FYI, race has a bigger statistical effect than class, but the effect of class is pretty freaking enormous, too. Also gender. 

I don't necessarily disagree with you, but por que no los dos? Why not both prison reform and criminal justice reform?
bmoc, Yeh I know. Down here in mississippi we're on that path though, unfortunately. Judges and sheriff's departments are corrupt all over the state. Most city police and highway patrolmen I've encountered are alright though.
bmoc, You are more ignorant than I thought if you really think I'm advocating locking people up for lack of intelligence.
MikeyDeez, 1) Most of the people managing these agencies are in their 40-50's

2) A fax means taking the page you want to send, putting it in the machine, hitting the phone number and "send"

3) Too much can go wrong with 48 year-olds scanning, locating, attaching, and downloading documents. .doc? .docx? .pdf? Word?  Adobe? ....confusions.

4) For some reason (and this is personally the most baffling) government thinks that faxes are more "secure" or at least less likely to have been altered than a scanned document.  It's pretty weird how  many times when you need a signed document, people will accept a fax but not a scanned email.

5) Edit:  Too many agencies have limits on the size of files that can be accepted by email servers; compressing and decompressing exacerbates #3
MikeyDeez, Thank you!

If you can figure out a way to make scanning documents intuitive for baby-boomers, and make the programs and file extensions universal, you could become very rich very quickly.
bignut, Sadly, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the roadblocks.  Several states in the Union have them, not just MS.

None, Ohhhhh, Bhutto.  I thought you said Bluto, and I haven't watched Popeye for years.  
None, Lets have Bill Cosby answer this one.  As a black man, he is somewhat of an authority:

1) The Cos says black men don't often take on a leadership role in parenting.

2)  Bill says culturally, blacks haven't valued education.  Quite the opposite.  Chris Rock says the same thing.

3). Socially, it's acceptable to speak and communicate to each other in a "way that isn't English."

These three simple things lead to every negative consequence on the list, which all point to higher unemployment and higher crime rates.  Clearly there are societal factors at play, but I think Bill is right that it starts with these basic tenets.

To a degree, it's a legacy as well.  Prison is almost A rite of passage in some subsets of the culture.  It's a sign of respect.  If you've been in jail, you're legit.

I would add that due to the high percentages of crimes committed in predominantly black neighborhoods, they are heavily policed, thus making it easier for blacks to get arrested for crimes that may be easier to get away with in non-black neighborhoods.  Some would call it "over-policing" but police are drawn to crime like moths to flames.  I don't think that is racist.  

Bottom line white Redditor friend: listen to Bill, he says "we cannot blame the white people any longer."  And that's really all I am saying.  You should listen to Bill.
caxica, damn dude you couldn't pay me to live there (no offense), and not just because of the corruption

MikeyDeez, I'm not saying their aren't universal file extensions, there just isn't a universal system that accepts and receives them...at least not as simply as a fax :P  People try opening them with Word, don't pay for Adobe, don't know how to compress/decompress files, email servers have ridiculously small limits on attachment sizes....

Trust me, it's fairly frustrating when you're in the position of having to deal with this on a daily basis! It's the only time in my life I still have to deal with a "busy" tone.
None, All fair points and I generally agree.

Change has to come from within the black culture though.  

And I truly believe Obama will give hope that wasn't there before, in a profound way.

But there are lessons to be learned from persecuted people like Jews, and minority populations around the world that have thrived in spite of multi-generational hardship.

Mormons were driven out of many US states and towns in their early days.  They even had an extermination order issued by a governor.  That's pretty serious.  You don't see them bitching about it though.  They focus on basic tenets of family/industry/education and generally do well as a result.


caxica, Every place has its upsides and downsides.   Here in MI it's nice but we have corrupt cops and politicos too, plus the winters can be absolutely brutal.

Up here I would never even think of voting Dem but the Republicans here are largely a different breed  than yours.  If I lived in MS I'd probably reconsider my stance on voting Dem
sporealy606, Please explain it to me.  You're the one that's been making this more about insults and one liners than actually discussing anything.  Please, leave your comfort zone and actually say something with substance.
bmoc, > Up here I would never even think of voting Dem but the Republicans here are largely a different breed than yours. If I lived in MS I'd probably reconsider my stance on voting Dem

First, I'm a conservative, but thats hard in Mississippi if you know what a conservative REALLY is and don't just assume conservative = republican. There is nothing even remotely close to conservative inside the state of MS politically atm. It's all greedy fuckers that distract stupid voters with fluff bills so they can continue getting paid.
bmoc, Everything that needs to be said has already been said by others. You ignore their arguments and bait them into insults so you can ignore the rest. 

So, I thought I was make it intellectually easy on you and skip the fluff.

rrhsandman, I know the guy who makes these (Black Pearl wood works). It's a small side business that he does on the side when he's not being a firefighter. He's super talented and makes really nice stuff. Unfortunately he never expected the original video to blow up like it did and he's been really overwhelmed with requests.

crazyScott90, Yeah. If there are kids in the home, a defensive firearm should just be stored in a quick access safe. There really is no good workaround for that.

This will not protect against a motivated burglar with a $5 pawn-shop hammer.  

-------

I'm being informed that the above safe is garbage after a few months.  Back to the drawing board.  

Get something from LockSAF/LockSāF if you can find it for sale... Deviant Ollam (world-renowned expert on 21st century security and locks) suggests the PBS-001 model, but it appears to be out of stock everywhere.  
crazyScott90, Inexpensive? Any model of Gun Vault will pretty much fill the space. But they're relatively easy to break into. If you want something actually secure and mountable I suggest LockSAF.
JDepinet, if your goal is to store a firearm safely away from kids, buy a good gun safe. if its to keep a defense weapon in in case of breakin, always carry. 

dexterity takes it in the nuts as soon as adrenaline gets going, opening a safe under pressure will be harder than you anticipate. and kids will get into anything but a combination locked safe. even that wont stop the bright ones, so firearms education is a must. and i dont mean "guns are grownup toys dont touch them" education. i mean actual "this is a gun, here is how you use it safely, and these are all the bad things that happen when you dont follow the rules" education.
Rick-Deckard, I have 2 safes from Barska, both have fingerprint opening within less than 2 seconds, very reliable and affordable.
Luckycoz, Not inexpensive, but I have [this](http://www.thegunbox.com). It's extremely effective and the easiest to open without having to fumble with combinations or finger patterns.  However, it's solely intended to prevent accessibility.

Ive had mine for about two and a half years and I absolutely love it. Plus, it has some additional functionality like USB plugs on it. 
crazyScott90, Well yeah. Other than that I mean.
crazyScott90, That should definitely be a part of a child's education. Secure storage is still essential until such a time that the parents deem their kids should have access. You have to also consider things like what would happen with friends of the kids coming over and deciding to snoop around.
southernbenz, I'm hoping his numbers were hyperbole. 
DammitDan, Damn, that's actually on the low end of what I expected. Thanks!
southernbenz, Happy to. 
asudan30, Costco sells these all the time for $60. 
Wyldfirewyrm, I have one of these. It would take a bit of work to get into it, but would be relatively easy to rip off the wall with a decent quality hammer or crowbar. 
firedogee, Good option. Definitely higher than my price range and a bit pricey considering it can be smashed with a cheap hammer. Any other options? 

What about this one for $42.00

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B015OZBYPK/ref=ya_st_dp_summary?ie=UTF8&psc=1
midnitesnacking, Do you have one of these? There are some bad reviews. Specifically one saying when the battery gets low it will open to almost anything. That concerns me
None, [deleted]
southernbenz, > I suggest LockSAF.

Deviant Ollam likes them, too.  They are certainly more expensive than the amazon.com cheap pistol safes, but apparently they are made significantly better... 

They aren't in stock anywhere, though.  
firedogee, What about safely away from kids while still using as home defense? 
southernbenz, You need to add the *http://* to effectively hyperlink on reddit.  

> TheGunBox

It's IoT?  Yikes.  I don't know.  To me, it looks like more IoT garbage that will fail as soon as the company goes under.  At least with a traditional lock-and-key gun safe, the safe company can go out of business and your gun safe will still be 100% functional.  


southernbenz, Exactly, good clarification.  Thanks.  It may take <10 minutes to break open with a hammer or mallet, but it would only <1 minute to rip it off whatever it's attached it to.

*Most* of these little <$100 vaults can be quickly popped open with [basic hand tools.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWohNkb09c)
DweadPiwateWoberts, Buy some perforated corner iron from home Depot and screw it in along the sides. No way it's getting pried up after that.
southernbenz, Again, hand tools will probably defeat it.  

What are you trying to protect against?  Are we just protecting against your children?  If so, I'm sure that'll do the trick.  You need to answer one question before selecting *any* gun safe: What are you hoping to accomplish?  

* Protecting your children from Daddy's toys: $100
* Protecting Daddy's drunk friends from Daddy's toys: $1000
* Protecting Daddy's toys from two professional thugs who know you'll be gone all weekend and brought their tools: $5000
mvm92, Unfortunately, most small gun safes are ridiculously easy to get into ([source](https://youtu.be/3SVMT_zNlgA)). Same goes really for most full size safes too.
juiceboxzero, I have the clamshell one, and I have one of the flip front ones.  Both GunVault brand.  When the battery gets low it doesn't open *at all*, because there isn't enough juice to actuate the latch release.

Ultimately, where you keep your gun(s) should be just one part of a more comprehensive home security posture.  If the way your house is set up, it's easy to get into, and they have time and privacy when they're in, then no safe is safe.  
southernbenz, It's a $95 safe... it's not going to be amazing.  But that being said, I'd feel confident that those experiences are not common.  
southernbenz, Wow.  That sucks.  
JDepinet, always maintain positive control of your weapon. i.e. carry it at all times.

this runs into a problem of what to do when asleep. for that i suppose there is no choice but to have a quick access safe. but imo that's an even worse time to be fumbling with a combo. in my mind education comes into play here again and simply having the weapon holstered on a nightstand should work, possibly in a drawer instead. basically some place your kids cant get to while you are sleeping, preferably within arms reach.
Luckycoz, To each their own. It was important for me to have something both secure to keep my two-and-a-half year old's hands out, but is easily accessible in an instant if someone breaks in. I wear the rfid bracelet on the arm closest to the safe and swing it out to open (I'm a back sleeper). It opens in 1 second without ever sticking. I'm extremely happy with its performance. 
PanGalacGargleBlastr, or just dropped on a corner.
southernbenz, > * Protecting Daddy's toys from two professional thugs who know you'll be gone all weekend and brought their tools: $5000

Graffunder (ideally) or Fort Knox (on a budget).  
workin2hard, What's the general feeling on Liberty Safes around here?  
firedogee, It's just for the little one. Drunk people don't come to my home and I've got a guard dog and 24hr CC cams for everything else. Like I said, I'm on a tight budget. 
Oakroscoe, Nice repost, but anyways I don't think a $5000 safe would hold up for a weekend if a burglar came prepared.  Remember this story about that canadien guy who had is vault broken into?  https://www.np.reddit.com/r/canadaguns/comments/1yt5l0/charges_dropped_in_mike_hargreaves_unsafe_storage/

If a burglar wants to get in and has enough time, he will get in. 


Edit: saw you gave credit to the original post down lower.  You're alright, even if you're a mod. 
hakuna_tamata, Yeah, at some point motivated professionals will just cut out the wall around the safe, take it with them, then taking a cutting torch to it.
TankerD18, If there's any way you can TLDR that dude's talk, I'd appreciate it. It sounds like an interesting talk but I'm not gonna watch 40 minutes of it, because I think my following point will still stand.

The whole point of a gun safe is to simply keep the fruit from hanging any lower. It's the same exact concept as glass windows. Any dumbass can break a window, it's just the point that 99% of dirtbags would rather go through an open window or an unlocked cellar door before busting a window in a residential neighborhood. 

With safes you're holding the fruit a little higher by prolonging the amount of *time* it takes to get access to your stuff. That's the whole point. A residential burglary is not a prolonged, elaborate heist like The Italian Job where they're planning every detail and trying to figure out how to defeat every security measure. Neighbors (if they live within eyeshot) are not going to let you sit in there with your mysterious Chevy Astro parked in the driveway for an hour while you defeat a safe and your buddies load these peoples' shit in the back. Most burglaries are an in and out affair, we're talking a *fifteen* minute burglary being abnormally long. They break in however they do it, tear shit up to find the most valuable things possible, and GTFO before one of the locals notices their license plate, starts taking photos, and calls the cops.

As for this little drawer in the OP, any serious burglar is going to tear that shit straight out of the cabinet it's in, notice it has something in it despite the point that he already emptied the non-concealed contents onto the floor, and he's gonna smash it or turn the knob and get your gun anyway.

I mean, if that dude in your link has an explanation for how Billy Bob the local low end, quick hit, residential burglar is going to crack your bolted to the floor, Browning combination safe in less than fifteen minutes I'd love to learn.
midnitesnacking, I'm just worried about children

southernbenz, >  I wear the rfid bracelet on the arm closest to the safe and swing it out to open (I'm a back sleeper). 

And you do this 365 nights a year? 
DGsirb1978, Haha, that's hilarious 
Oakroscoe, Decent for the money, but it's definitely not top level protection.  They'll stop a smash and grab, but like most safes if a burglar has tools (read: an angle grinder) they'll be beaten. 
southernbenz, Somewhere above Stack-On and below Fort Knox and Graffunder.  
southernbenz, If you're on a budget, get that $42 one.  I'm sure it'll do a decent job; read the reviews.  But I'd recommend also saving up for a few months and replacing it with a better safe when your finances catch back up.  
southernbenz, > Edit: saw you gave credit to the original post down lower. You're alright, even if you're a mod.

It took two days and blow torches.  

On a side note: If he had motion-sensors like he claimed he did, the cops should have been there in thirty minutes.  
mvm92, The TL;DW of that dudes talk is basically, most compact gun safes can be defeated relatively easily with some hand tools and ingenuity. Defeated here means opened without damaging the safe. And all of these exploits happen in seconds. Of course, you can almost always just pull these things apart with a pry bar and a hammer in a few seconds but what's the fun in that?
southernbenz, > crack your bolted to the floor, Browning combination safe in less than fifteen minutes I'd love to learn.

Those ~$1000 safes are all made of the same thing: a few millimeters of steel, and some drywall for fire protection.  You can cut the sides open with a $50 Home Depot portable angle grinder and fifteen minutes.  

Most Graffunder vaults will be 1" A36, plus concrete, and an interior steel wall.  It would take a serious piece of equipment, probably an Oxy torch, to get inside.  
xaronax, Education and exposure are your first lines of defense. 

Past that, quick access safes usually suck. :(
southernbenz, What's the make and model of your new one? 
Luckycoz, Yes. I put the bracelet on every night. Just like I put a watch on every morning. 
The_Tea_Incident, To be fair with enough time and cutting disks a thief will defeat anything with an angle grinder.

Keep your safe bolted to the floor and make sure what ever they do to it will be noticed before they finish.
Oakroscoe, Fair points.  
TankerD18, I mean fair point that getting into a safe is possible with some basic power tools, but is cutting a hole in a safe with an angle grinder, or prying it open, really a sensible solution for a common stooge that is trying to get in and out ASAP, and doesn't know exactly what's inside the place until he gets in it? Not to mention the point that they know that the neighbors are going to find it odd that an unusual vehicle is parked outside, likely midday, with an angle grinder and hammers blaring away inside? 

You can case the joint for days, that doesn't mean you exactly know there's a gun safe or what have you inside. Remember, most of these guys are going for the quick in and out, easy grab kind of stuff. Any burglar worth his salt isn't going to go ham on a safe when they're trying not to protract their time on the premises. They aren't exactly stupid, getting caught is a hundred times worse than not getting some of a person's valuables. 

I'm not saying that it's not possible, or it's not feasible/plausible, but it just seems like a little bit of a stretch for a common burglar's playbook. Plain and simple, you're putting the fruit high enough on the tree to deter the large majority from doing anything about it. We can argue in circles all day about how easy it is or isn't to get into a safe, doesn't mean Joe Blow the Burglar is going to actually commit to it during the act.

Appreciate the TLDW too, good talking to you.
southernbenz, I'd like to see someone defeat a nicer Graffunder safe with an angle grinder... 
gesis, It's been a long time, but a couple buddies of mine and myself broke into a "secure" fire safe the summer after senior year of high school. We were out adventuring in an abandoned manufacturing plant and found some sealed safes... and being teenagers, we wanted to know what was inside.

It took all of an hour. The only tools we had were a hammer, a chisel, a pry-bar, and a cheap oxy-acetylene torch. Three layers of 1/4" steel and two layers of concrete. You couldn't get a good enough heat on the metal to just blast through it because of all the concrete, but a 3' bar and a hole let us open it mostly like a can opener.

We went in through the back, not the door, and just peeled the metal down and chiseled away the non-reinforced concrete inside. We peeled almost the entire outermost layer off in a few minutes, but each hole got successively smaller. At the end, we had about an 18" hole to work around in.

There was nothing inside.
Pariahdog119, I am a machinist. I guarantee that I can crack your safe, if you bring it to my shop and help me put it in this mill and clamp it down securely and I have enough carbide bits...
The_Tea_Incident, If we can crowdfund the cost of the safe I would be happy to put the footage on YouTube! 
TankerD18, > There was nothing inside.

Talk about a anticlimactic ending.

I'm not doubting some of the other replies saying that a couple pros could bust into all but the best safes in minutes with the right tools, sure. The thing is that the extreme majority of burglars aren't going to commit like that. 
southernbenz, > if you bring it to my shop

All Graffunder weapon safes are over 1200 lbs, most of them are 2000-4000 lbs+ and made of 1.0" hardened steel.

Could you defeat it?  Maybe... if you took out a wall in the house to break up the foundation and unbolt it, move it with specialized lifting equipment, load it onto a dual-axle trailer, and then haul it to your shop.  

Otherwise, you'd have to *bring* your whole machine shop *to* the vault.  
southernbenz, Go search through youtube videos of people cutting a36 plates (or steel I-beams, usually the same material) with angle grinders, and find the thickest one.  The thickest I could find was 11mm, which is still under half an inch, and the person spent seemingly hours cutting just a few inches of material...

Most Graffunder safes use 1.0" A36, plus concrete for the fire material, and an interior body with a thinner steel (~18ga).  You cannot get through that with an angle grinder.  You would burn through motors and disks just getting into the cut.  
gesis, I was only sharing that I know without a doubt that three determined idiots can get into a "good" safe in about an hour without too much ruckus using the tools they had in their truck.

I'd hate to see what a couple determined meth heads would be capable of in that time.
Pariahdog119, I'm gonna need a bigger forklift.

1" hardened steel is the smallest part of the problem. With a carbide mill I can eat right through it. The problem would be if it's sandwiched with layers of other materiel (for example, soft aluminum,) because the change could bind up the tool and break it off. Aluminum melts at the temperatures generated by cutting hardened steel.

edit: the biggest problem would probably involve locating a machine large enough to put the safe on the table. Most don't have the capability to do anything too large. The vertical machines in my shop could handle something 18"x3'x5' max, most likely. The horizontals could deal with 3' or 4' cubes.

Other shops that work with larger parts would have bigger machines - shops that make railroad locomotive parts or other heavy machinery, for example.
fearthestorm, give me 1/2 hour with a oxygen lance
southernbenz, They do have an interior body with thin steel.  The armored plating on the exterior is the 1" plate, and the fire material is sandwiched.

You'll have to drill out all 8+ bolts to get the door to open... even if you had a mobile and perpendicular-mounting mill, it would take days to do so.  
southernbenz, You would destroy everything inside the vault with slag and fire. 
Pariahdog119, I think I'd take a 3" shell mill with carbide inserts, and interpolate a 5" circle big enough to reach through. The inserts will break when the material changes, but I can just change the inserts.

The little portable routers you could attach to the safe are slow and weak. That's why I'd want to mount the safe in the machine, instead.
southernbenz, > That's why I'd want to mount the safe in the machine, instead.

You'll need some big moving equipment to do that... 
Pariahdog119, I think a typical forklift could probably handle it.

It's certainly a lot more work than a typical safe cracker is going to go through, though - dragging it out of the house, loading onto a truck, finding a heavy machine shop, loading it in the mill with a forklift...

None, Can someone please make a movie of this man's life? 
minorwhite, Awesome dude!
Jo_Violet, Thank you for sharing this with us.  I think that we have impact like this often, but it is not always shared back with us.  I always joke that now he can go home and decide if he really wants to fight about who took the trash out last becasue he is no longer mad at his wife for not having sex/the kind of sex he wants.  American culture, and I think most western cultures as well, teach men that casual touch, hugging, cuddling and that incredible validation we get from skin to skin contact is only allowable through sex.  So when issues arise between a husband and wife and sex stops or slows down or changes, the gent is often left feeling more than the absence of orgasm, he is mostly missing that acceptance and relaxation that comes with all the other parts of the experience. He can't get cuddles from even their best friend, getting a long relaxing hug that releases endorphin's requires 20 seconds or so to kick in, but what benefits!

http://www.collective-evolution.com/2015/12/03/the-chemistry-of-hugging-11-benefits-of-hugging/

So we withhold all this stuff from men because society shames them for hugging each other for long periods of time, and then we wonder why they see sex workers once their wives are not providing this for them either!

I am glad you have found your safe haven, that both of you have each other, and I wish you the best as you continue to face the challenges you have...I think you have a great foundation to build on. 
unaotradesechable, This is amazing. I'm happy you found peace
strawbola, Wow so happy for you! 
None, I always burst out into tears whenever I read this kind of story. A client gets married with an escort. It's beautiful. Thank you for sharing 
th_veteran, Thank you for your service.

And my experience was similar to yours -- my problems were not nearly so severe, but they certainly felt severe to me and there have been many days that a kind, diligent sex-worker made life much closer to tolerable.
AssistantMari, This is one of the best things I've read today, I'm happy you made it through.
AliceLittleSBR, Thank you for sharing your story- and congrats on your marriage! Additionally, i applaud you openly discussing your experiences with mental health. Far too frequently our society stigmatizes even the mentioning of seeking help- so I try to make it a point to applaud those who do discuss such things. Best wishes for you and your wife, and may your lives be filled with happiness! 
CeruleaAzura, So we're supposed to be happy that you betrayed your first wife? Omg I'm so pleased you're a piece of shit, well done. Glad your current wife approves but I'm not gonna cheer for you when you hurt your first wife so badly.
GGking41, This was amazing to read.
Not every one has such a beautifully positive experience but I'm so happy you did and that you discovered it right when you needed it, it's funny how life works.
I've often said that many of my clients almost use the sex s an excuse but actually need to connect with someone and feel valued and important after being treated poorly for a long time.    
I'm glad your life is what you want it to be now!
None, Sex workers did not keep your wife safe. With or without it is your actions. You had unprotected sex and contracted a "blood disorder" which could have well been HIV or Hepatitis B,C. Is that keeping your wife safe? NO WAY! You could be tried for attempted murder in some states.
None, Is she still a hooker?
asshair, Wait so is your wife still hooking?
Segreto86, yes that would be amazing, sex workers are portrayed so negatively in most media
tucfun, Hell no. Dispite that it puts SexWorkers in a good light. Don't think that's acceptable in hollywood
blkarthoe, I rather people use thus so we can make sex work legal and safe and accessible for everyone. 
tucfun, Thank you, that's all I can say to your thoughtful and educating comment.
tucfun, Thanks
tucfun, thanks
tucfun, Ironically I met her at Target, not as a client.  By some strange coincidence she turned out to be an escort.
tucfun, I wish there was a more public way, some where that people truly would have access to our experiences.  I doubted I was alone.  
tucfun, Thanks
tucfun, Your entitled to your opinion.  I guess it would have been better if i eould have shot her, sarcasm.  You should read a little about PTSD before you comment by the way.  
tucfun, I can never do anything without researching it first.  I honestly believe that is the key to my positive experience, the research and also my attraction to mature woman.  30 somethings to 50 somethings were mostly my preference, that and only established independents. 
tucfun, Who had unprotected sex?  Besides, if you are brave enough to comment, you sholud be brave enough to stick around for the discussion.  
tucfun, I guess the best way to describe it is she works part time for a few select clients for three day to week long companionship.   
tucfun, I actually answered your question on a different post.  If you are really interested in the answer please read through the comments of this post https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/4c37oy/i_am_a_41_year_old_man_married_to_a_semiretired/

I'm cool about answering any other questions too.
tucfun, I see I repeated what you said. Hadn't read it when I replied to the op
funnilizatt, Gotta start somewhere. Besides, look at the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise. Who knew how much it would take off?
None, Yes a story of man cheating on his wife and getting HIV, which endangered her life... great movie for promoting SW.
CeruleaAzura, I understand PTSD pretty well considering two of my close family members suffer from it. However it's not an excuse to betray someone you supposedly love. I understand how difficult it is and how strong you are for coping with it but I still think you're a bad person for not feeling guilty for what you did. 
tucfun, Can't argue with that.  Right cast throw in some sex and a good looking cast.

But I don't think is more interesting than a few paragraphs 
tucfun, I didn't tell my story for people to like me, I told my story to show a different perspective of the role sexworkers play in our society.  If it wasn't for sexworkers I could have physically hurt myself, worst yet my ex.  Luckily I didn't.  It's not easy to talk about ones own faults, but I thought my story was worth telling.
