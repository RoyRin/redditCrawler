-Mavoko-: 25 : HAS SCIENCE GONE TO FAR?!

Treesdofuck: 102 : When two men love each other or two women love each other. They often go into a same sex relationship!

PM_ME_REINHARDT_R34: 53 : Sarcastic about what? There wasn't even a joke there 

Orthodox-Waffle: 32 : Hi, Sarcastic! What are you now?

cuddlegoop: 183 : Ok what about 2 non-binary people though. Or a woman and a non-binary person? Are those gay?

I vote yes to the first because obvs and yes to the second because more gay = more good. 

I_amLying: 97 : Gay is usually used for sex, not gender.  A better question would be "what about hermaphrodites".

None: 9 : [deleted]

I_amLying: 276 : Yep, pretty much.

The problem people have with this is that language is fluid, words have multiple definitions that can even change over time.   That's why some people prefer to qualify the terms by saying things like "biological sex" instead of just sex, clear up ambiguity.

n60storm4: 80 : Sex is what you physically have and gender is what you identify as/mentally are.

hypo-osmotic: 354 : I've heard of the phrases andro/gynosexual that you can use to describe the binary sex you're attracted to without having to refer to your own gender (both gay men and straight women would be androsexual, for example) but I've never actually heard of anyone using it to describe themselves. I think someone who dates a NB person would probably be bi/pan.

Treesdofuck: 91 : I don't understand why you're getting downvoted but I also don't understand your question. 

cuddlegoop: 90 : Sorry I asked a nonsense jokey question on a meme sub and everyone took it seriously fml. 

The_Plumbot: 82 : What is gay? Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more. 🎶

 His name is David R. Eddwards Davidreddwards D R EDDwards
the idea was to have like a no nonsense like judge dredd kinda dude, it was more of an experiment than anything.
 For other reasons i retired this character, getting into some other characters and whatnot is the main reason for that. 
 I will play characters i think are fun and interesting even if others dont end of story.

slashFIX: 354 : I mean, everyone knew it was just a character and the voice and acting all that was a roleplay. Even Timmac in his VOD somewhere said that (and continued to get butthurt).

I don't think your RP should be affected just because someone got annoyed. If every character is your typical "crazy stoner / undercover agent" then RP gets really stale and boring.

shadowfox362: 659 : Seriously.  Finkone talking about Langley's performance.  All the times Timmac was salty about being arrested because he felt it wasn't fair. Timmac talking shit on Gunit.  Eli constantly defining power gaming and then telling Wish she had to submit paperwork for mental evals.  Eli yelling at Saab to get back in his car after he pulled over following Eli rear-ending his vehicle.  Then defending his actions by saying his (Eli) character feared for his life.  Eli jailing people repeatedly for things they honestly didn't do just based on the premise that the accused couldn't prove they were innocent--but you're welcome to take the 9999's if you disagree!

Benmjt: 595 : They could do an entire episode on Proxy as well. Ella and Shaggy did insane shit hundreds of time, and not only escaped punishment—be that through cops going easy on them or powergaming their way out—but also somehow avoided the 9s (Ella was clearly a psychopath unsafe to be on the streets), and then has the audacity to lambast others for the exact same shit they'd been doing for months, and got famous for. Same with Katie Rage (as touched on in the vid) somehow managed to get away with being an EMS (great for being at crime scenes) while basically being an action star in her spare time.

shadowfox362: 646 : I think first and foremost they need to be reminded that **it's a video game**.  What's the point of punishing people for being goofy or trying to have fun and be entertaining.  You can still aim for realism and serious rp without going to such lengths to make people angry when it comes to enforcement.  Don't want characters acting outside of their usual established behavior? Perhaps the last few months should have been spent on actually developing a server that allowed multiple character slots.  What other choice did people have? I've heard their meeting where they suggest multiple steam accounts for new characters.  Are you kidding me? 

AticusCaticus: 214 : > Finkone talking about Langley's performance.

bogus468: 1691 : Timmac, Eli, Proxy, Wish, Finkone and Classy are all not to be trusted.

Timmac used to stream snipe lirik heavily back in the day > Proxy leeched timmac > Eli leeched Lirik and anyone else he could pre first stream > Finkone rode on Elis coat tails, Wish leeched everyone and always has and classy would be nowhere without exposure from some of these people.

Something to take from all of this and what people need to understand is that they have the same motives as one another and they're all very close and exclusive, they owe each other a lot for their privladged careers. It's the ultimate Twitch clique formed of a bunch of people who pretend to be someone else for a living in video games. None of them want to lose this oppertunity and they're willing to network together to make sure that never happens. Thats really what FamilyRP appears to have been all about from the very beginning. A closed off server where they could hand pick people and deny those who one or more of them don't get on with or like.

End of the day more new RP games will keep coming out, they will use one another to get themselves all to the top, they'll control the views and people won't even know any of this ever happened. Back to step one. We know they read this subreddit and we know their stratergy to remove admins off the roster was damage control. Until they attempt to talk about why they allow blatent favoritism and admit their actual faults, I see no reason to trust a single one of them. They are out for nobody but themselves and they're all as bad as each other. If even a single one of them knew something wasn't right and they were decent people, they'd have spoken up about it by now.

Scantlander: 668 : Lets be serious here. ClassyPax blows away everyone when it comes to RP. All the different characters he has created and how well he does with each... He is in a league of his own and to say he wouldn't be here without the exposure of others is ridiculous. He hasn't been playing GTA 5 RP that long.... hell he hasn't even RPed that long and he has gained TONS of followers and subs.

There really isn't too many family RPers I don't like. I was sad to see Eli go but I can understand why people are pissed at him. This is why admins shouldn't play the game. But I fail to see why Classy is involved in this drama. Is it just because he is friends with Eli? #confused.

lurkinsince07: 25 : so timmac was like greek?

dukeslver: 1138 : One thing i'll say about Eli is that he never purposely leeched off Lirik. He also wasn't a streamer at the time or anything. He def got popular and grew a following because of his appearances on Lirik's streams though, but calling him a leech is pretty harsh. 

Finkone was also popular on youtube and was streaming waaaay before Eli started streaming, so he def did not get popular because of Eli. The man became popular as far back as 2-3 years ago from his GTAIV and LSPDFR youtube videos (which is how I found out about him). He probably is/was one of the most popular LSPDFR streamers so he had a really big following from way before GTA V RP was even a thing. Eli absolutely made him more popular and got him more exposure to a new audience, but its really incredulous to say that he "rode Elis coat tails" because it's really not true. It would be like saying Mr. Moon is only popular because he rode Elis coattails, it's just not true. 

Not trying to be a shill or defend these guys or anything, just trying to set the record straight as I don't want people to believe this stuff you are saying without seeing the full picture. 

Riotken: 1268 : >Eli is that he never purposely leeched off Lirik

what? He was literally getting on and appearing where Lirik was doing his thing in SoE. Watch any of Liriks streams and see the huge spam of his steam name (SoE showed everyone who tried to join as Timed out) also see his Pink messages "party is over everyone" exactly as he joined the server and everyone were at a random house party. He knew exactly what he was doing. He also had a youtube channel back before Lirik even knew about SoE, you don't need to stream on twitch to want attention any other media will do.

If you are talking about noumbers than your second example is bad. You compared Finkone to MrMoon... Just back before Eli was streaming MrMoon had bigger youtube (only) stats than the whole police force from SoE. You said Finkone had a big following from way before GTA v rp he right now has only 20k subscribers back then I doubt he had even close to 10k which is not even close to "popular". 

See the full picture? Everyone knew exactly what he was doing. Same reason as developers pay/want popular streamers to play their games happened here. Timmac knew that Lirik would try gta RP so he brought him to SoE, Lirik knew about Eli and that he was the center of attention there so he went there. 

bogus468: 917 : Eli used to find lirik in the most ridiculous places, RP with him, then clip it and tweet it out minutes later. Eli also has 5 VAC bans on his Steam account too just to add to the shady shit. It was also a running meme that Finkone was somewhat the forgotten cop as he got significantly less views and really didn't do all that well pre-eli. His socialblade stats show the significant increase the month Eli started streaming in May. Sure he was doing okay before that but again that's only because of the same people we're talking about here. As for his YouTube. He only has 20k followers and pretty low view numbers. Those don't really translate well to twitch streaming normally. Yes, he had small success in the past, and his stream was doing okay, but again the massive growth was still from these people mentioned.

Mr. Moon was an odd choice btw. He's been getting 2,000+ viewers a stream for like 4 years now.

What part of "adding context" of my comment did you not understand?

bunnymud: 42 : Looks like Eli has been gaining followers.

shadowfox362: 737 : > Looks like Eli has been gaining followers.

Nobody was talking about followers; we were talking about average viewers.  If you want to talk about followers though, of course the linked chart is going to show a follower gain because it's a chart that goes back to when he started streaming.

He's losing followers over the 2 week period and has only gained 213 in the last 30 days.  Compare that with any streamer that doesn't even pull 1000 viewers where they've gained thousands of followers over that same timeframe.

Bubbles, AKA Peter Ross has gained more followers than Eli and he averages less than 100 viewers per stream.

bellhopkiller: 381 : Happy New Year Everyone! 

A New Year is often an opportunity for a new start - the past is the past and TFRP looks forward to stepping into the New Year with a renewed sense of fairness and equal treatment for all and leave the claims of hypocrisy, nepotism, incompetence, lack of communication and unwhitelistings behind us in 2017 for good. . .

heloise_the_nun: 834 : And here I had hopes that somehow the admins grew up, due to the lack of drama recently. A new year and another character who's not in proxy's clique gets banned.

Also: This is why talking to someone before banning them is a great idea. A conversation can not only avoid a ban, but you can get a sense for if the person means well and just misunderstood a situation, or is genuinely hostile toward the rules. Bans should only be given when it is clear the player does not intend to continue following the rules.

Also again: TFRP brand public relations strikes again. As an admin, when you tell someone a decision was made about them without their input in a patronizing text message, you are creating your own drama. People at their core just want to be understood, and if you just have a conversation you'll fix 90% of your issues.

Vstringcheese: 222 : It is sad when gtarp, stripped to the core is talking to one another, yet Penta can't take 5 mins to communicate to another fellow rp'er..seems hateful and disturbing just like kimchi's ban. Saddening and utterly pitiful.

EvilEyeMonster: 391 : He just doesnt get it

roleplayers complain about his actions but he still doesnt understand its his fault

Adios you mentally deranged lunatic

[HAHAHAHAHAHAHA](https://i.imgur.com/FonGHlt.jpg?1)
#Boycott FamilyRP TOP KEK

Yet again like SOE he has his power taken away from him and he quits, FamRP takes away his precious 9's and he quits.... unbelivable

Adios Eli you will not be missed.

Wodilio: 468 : It objectively is not like it was with SOE, because if it were, he would've quit as soon as he wasn't an admin anymore(aka his authority having lost the respect of the servers lead), but this time he quit as soon as the 9's-system was "toned down". If you want to talk shit then at least be smart about it, or you only make yourself look bad, especially at a time like this, when you basically already "won" regarding Eli and have no reason to be so "extreme" anymore.

heloise_the_nun: 280 : Eli's excuse that SOE "doesn't like streamers" was just that. If you were paying attention, GeeFamous complained to the SOE admins about Eli's treatement of FireZone. The next day, Eli got demoted. Gee doesn't have nearly as many viewers, so most people just believed Eli's story.

EvilEyeMonster: 329 : > he would've quit as soon as he wasn't an admin anymore(aka his authority having lost the respect of the servers lead)

Ever heard of the word Misdirection?

Just becouse it was taken off a website doesnt mean it was followed through, he wouldnt have the authority to ban people from the server with the 9's if he wasnt an admin

Genozyde: 372 : > It objectively is not like it was with SOE, because if it were, he would've quit as soon as he wasn't an admin anymore(aka his authority having lost the respect of the servers lead), but this time he quit as soon as the 9's-system was "toned down". 

You do know that he know all the admins and have a very, very big influence on them right? Basically what he said goes.

Wodilio: 581 : And you do realise, that the event of toning down the 9's and him quitting due to that, means, that you are wrong with your statement(influence etc). Unless, of course, you were saying that in regards to if it was or wasn't the same, as it was with SOE and if you were saying it regarding that, then still: No, because he also knew the admins etc there and when the whole SOE thing went down, he wasn't seen as the problem by the majority of the people, which is why the people followed him, giving yet another major difference in comparison to how it went down this time, on TFRP.

EvilEyeMonster: 107 : Honestly i dont give a shit what you think

That lunatic is gone and my sunday just got a whole lot better.

Wodilio: 336 : I'm not surprised, but thank you for agreeing with me by showing that you have no arguement contradicting with mine, even though you did still make yourself look like a child by portaying a "I can't lead a discussion so I am going to be loud, "edgy" and extreme"-mentality(which is ironically close to Eli, by the way). Have a nice day!

EvilEyeMonster: 130 : [babyKnight](#babyKnight) [babyKnight](#babyKnight) [babyKnight](#babyKnight) [babyKnight](#babyKnight) [babyKnight](#babyKnight) 

Wodilio: 307 : Exactly; case in point, thank you very much! - also @heloise_the_nun - if true or not: that in no way, shape, or form, changes anything about the point I was making, which is, that this time it was not the same as on SOE - don't know if the whole point just went over your head or something, but it happens.

None: 126 : Trying to watch the full vod where he explains but does he actually say in the vod where he tells his viewers to 'boycott rp'?

EvilEyeMonster: 43 : Click the link it was his chat that said it

None: 24 : Yes but Not Eli himself.

heloise_the_nun: 145 : He's incapable of handling conflict. I feel like this is confirmation that the way he treated FireZone was the real reason he kicked of SOE too. 

dre__: 244 : Was firezone that old grandpa that was a vet? If so then he deserved the 9s though. He was mentally unstable enough to shoot a gun in public at imaginary soldiers. It was a law on SOE to give 9s to someone like that and wait for a mental eval. 

None: 165 : If I remember right, I think he wanted a mental evaluation for his character. I don't remember how it worked on SoE though. Didn't he get banned and not just the 9s?

dre__: 225 : That may have been after. I remember he had to wait like a week before going to court. The court sentenced him to doing any remaining jail time left and then going to a psychiatrist twice week after the jail time was served. 

zlonaldmumph: 44 : Wow his viewers live in a tiny little bubble

babloman: 825 : I actually enjoyed watching Eli for awhile. I understand he went ape shit and started messing up and then he doesn't realize that half of the stuff he does is his fault and won't apologize for it, but Eli made myself get into RP. He made me more interested into playing as a cop rp wise. He made TheFamilyRP what it is by bringing a bunch of people to start watching. He is one of the funniest guys out there and it is truly heart breaking to see one of your favorite streamers to be hated on by everyone. Now, I'm not defending him and saying that what he did wasn't wrong, but I think that people should give him a break. He quit GTAVRP because of the amount of hatred he is getting. Ik there are people who don't care and probably think I'm irrelevant for commenting this. But honestly I think we should layoff of the guy.

nightblossom: 32 : Thank god for a voice of reason.

sheren36d: 696 : I'd say that he quit FRP because even most dedicated people on admin board  finally saw his pattern of winning at all costs, which lead to server population decline, and almost no new players (apart form LEO's) , because people were well aware of possibility of them being jailed for a random sneeze or crossing a street on a red light (which due to desync often cause lots of issues, for LEO it may be red, for player it shows green, and guess what, if that LEO would be Eli - your ass is getting fined at minimum, if your scrub ass dares to talk back - it will be booty house with lots of dick-to-ass action, and I'm not getting it outta my head, heard those words on his stream several times).

Tecashi: 175 : Nope, even if the admins re-whitelisted all the leanboys, the FamRP server doesn't have the features NoPixel has right now, so they would just be going back to parking lot RP.

Pinalope4Real: 176 : Nothing like finishing the housework, put the vacuum away..see that the laundry had actually NOT started...then go to run hand through hair, only to find a beetle on your head!

msnaughtykitty: 62 : Ewww 
Oh and thanks for the reminder I have to switch laundry 

Pinalope4Real: 6 : hahaha

neongreenpurple: 146 : I hate when that happens.  The laundry not starting happens a lot at my house because the lid is funky.  You have to push it in, not just shut it.

Pinalope4Real: 59 : At least I only had 2 loads to do....lol. But it is a pain!

neongreenpurple: 86 : I probably have three loads to do, ugh.  I hate laundry.  Luckily they can wait a bit.

Pinalope4Real: 71 : I have more to do this weekend...this was just towels and bath mats lol

neongreenpurple: 41 : Oh man.  Laundry: the never ending story.

Pinalope4Real: 90 : Yup.,..I'll be doing lots so we can pack up for vacation....then imagine when we get home!

neongreenpurple: 41 : Oh joy.  But at least you get a vacation.

Pinalope4Real: 92 : I'd rather stay home...LOL....except the Baltimore stop, that I am really looking forward to

neongreenpurple: 66 : Hehehe, I hope you enjoy Baltimore, and maybe the other stops too.

Pinalope4Real: 55 : Oh I will! And the other stop is our usual summer trip.

neongreenpurple: 7 : Oh fun!

Pinalope4Real: 229 : Baltimore is the meetup, so that I am excited about...the rest, not so much, we weren't going to go this year...wanted to change, but he decided to go one more time :-/ we'll see....I may just stay on our deck the entire week lol

neongreenpurple: 109 : Oh fun!  I want to go to a meetup sometime!  I hope you find something to enjoy while you're there, at least.

Pinalope4Real: 102 : You should get to one if you can! It's fun meeting people! I'll do lots of relaxing on the lake hahaha

neongreenpurple: 114 : I hope to get to the next Nashville one.  Unfortunately there wasn't a whole lot of interest for a Memphis one. :/

Pinalope4Real: 54 : Hard to believe people wouldn't want to go to Memphis!

neongreenpurple: 25 : I was kinda disappointed.

Pinalope4Real: 6 : I bet.

neongreenpurple: 64 : It's a shame.  I'd love to not have to travel to go to a meetup.

Pinalope4Real: 149 : It would be nice, yeah. The one in October, we're traveling....but only doing the one day for the meetup, then hitting a NASCAR race on the way back.

neongreenpurple: 37 : At leats it's part of a regular trip.

Pinalope4Real: 188 : Well no....the meetup was the first plan, but then we saw we could hit Martinsville on the way back. So we'll spend the Saturday with the gang here....then head off for the race on Sunday.

neongreenpurple: 15 : Oh that's cool!

kittehmew: 185 : I was going to go outside and do something, and then on the screendoor, which doesn't shut properly, there is a giant bee and two beetles. So I was like... fuck, I'm not going outside. 

kittehmew: 185 : I was going to go outside and do something, and then on the screendoor, which doesn't shut properly, there is a giant bee and two beetles. So I was like... fuck, I'm not going outside. 

Pinalope4Real: 91 : I had a preying mantis hold me hostage almost all day once by staying on my front door. LOL

kittehmew: 320 : I would go near one of those, and try and move it, even the bee, probably, even though it is one of the biggest I've seen in this state, I swear. But the beetles? Fuck no. Those June bugs almost kill my every year, at least one flies into my hair and I cry and then I feel like they're crawling on me for the next week. 

pyroglass: 38 : remember, lady bugs are beetles too :)

Pinalope4Real: 158 : Yes....those I don't mind. Oh man, but their little friggin' larvae BITE!!! And the Japanese Stink Beetles that look so much like them...ack! Infestation! LOL

YouMakeMyVaginaSmile: 223 : Ick! Beetles creep me out. We had a termite problem in our house once. We realized we had a problem when termites starting crawling out of the ceiling in my room. One fell on my head. I still cringe thinking about that day.

Pinalope4Real: 22 : OMG!!!!! I'd die!!!!!!

YouMakeMyVaginaSmile: 40 : A little part of me did die that day... 

Pinalope4Real: 32 : Ugh....I am all creeped out now.

YouMakeMyVaginaSmile: 16 : Hahaha sorry :P 

Pinalope4Real: 63 : LOL it's ok....I'll survive....until another bug attacks me LOL

YouMakeMyVaginaSmile: 304 : Hahaha let's just hope that doesn't happen. :P I have a weird relationship with bugs. I get creeped out by them but I also hate killing them. I was painting yesterday and a wasp/bee thing flew into the paint and got paint all over its wings and head. It was dying so I killed it but I felt so bad... Haha

Pinalope4Real: 76 : I won't go out of my way to kill them...but if they threaten me, die!!!! LOL

Metabilities: 3 : o.o

Pinalope4Real: 8 : Exactly!

IDFKwhereGilliganIs: 137 : Omg. I hate beetles. Also, I frequently start the laundry but don't actually start the laundry. I need an automatic start or something XD

Pinalope4Real: 201 : It surprised me....I rarely freak out over bugs on me, but I only felt it, didn't see it, and after my evil bee thing last week....I danced hahaha


Yeah, I didn't push the button enough I guess hahaha

IDFKwhereGilliganIs: 95 : I do the bug dance as well! Bugs on my skin don't freak me out, it's when they get in my hair. 

Pinalope4Real: 109 : I think I scared the dog hahahah...then when the bug was on the floor, he failed to eat it. I need a new dog!

IDFKwhereGilliganIs: 172 : Dang dog. I have 5 cats that would just stare at it after creating a cat circle around it. And my dog would probably just bark at it. Animals don't understand their duties!

Pinalope4Real: 191 : Hahahaah I miss my old cat, Poufurrr, she would hunt and kill all bugs! She would cry to get you to pick her up if there was one on the ceiling...sadly, my husband hates cats and is allergic.

IDFKwhereGilliganIs: 181 : Omg I love that name. That sounds adorable. I'm actually allergic to cats but take an allergy pill every day. But I also ~~ don't hate~~ love cats, so that's kinda a big difference.

suckinonmytitties: 407 : hey everyone! haven't been on raoa a lot this week because it's my last week of clinical and I need to work on my in-service presentation for next week but I would love to procrastinate and chat you guys up! 

so… what's going on in your life? what are your opinions on fried pickles? what movie has everyone else seen that you still have never watched? (I just watched Jumanji for the first time yesterday)

StefanieH: 38 : Omg I totally forgot about that movie.

jibas: 995 : Hi!  Good luck on your presentation next week!! Life for me is interesting right now, I had to stop talking to my best friend because feelings got in the way. I guess that's one of the things you have to worry about when developing a friendship with the opposite gender. We just weren't on the same page and it sucked for both of us, especially because she's really the only person I want to talk to right now :(  

It's all good though, I'm on vacation with my family now and am enjoying myself and maybe in a few weeks or months we can try to rebuild what we had. Anyway sorry for spilling my guts it's been on my mind a lot and I had to tell somebody so lucky you and the rest of RAOA :)

 Fried pickles are eh.. Idk I love fried food and I love pickles but I can't seem to enjoy the taste as much together.  And I've never seen a single James Bond movie, I know it's bad.  Whenever my friends reference them I just go along like I know what they're talking about.  

How's your day going? :)

suckinonmytitties: 752 : Hey thanks for responding! Also sorry to hear about the things going on with your best friend and I hope that you guys can get past it soon so you can stay close friends. I've totally been there though and a break is probably just what you need in the long run.

Anyways where are you on vacation at? Also I just tried fried pickles yesterday and they were weird because warm pickles are gross but it was still good. Also  last month at a baseball game I came across FRIED CINNAMON BUNS- they are amazinggggg.

My day is going pretty well but I got a nasty cough going on today and almost accidentally coughed right on a patient today haha. I managed not to so that's good but I would love to stop being sick asap! Also yay for tomorrow being Friday :D

jibas: 507 : Omg fried cinnamon bun...

We are in Door County, it's a little peninsula on Lake Michigan in Wisconsin.  There's a bunch of cool little shops and things like that so it's a good distraction right now.  With my parents and me working and my sisters in summer school it's nice to spend a little time with my family!

I really hope you feel better! Especially before that presentation.  If you like it try some hot tea! I didn't care for it but it definitely made my throat feel better after I caught a cough!

The only thing I didn't like was living as a night time worker in a day time world, anytime I had things to do it felt like I had to be up so early to be there before the place closed. That's hard when you go to sleep at 7 or 8 am

kalanz: 443 : I know it's still there, but why are you looking at my WL now? Everyone else says they want to hear me play; only she said that I should have fun learning to play. SHE SAW IT BEFORE IT WAS PURCHASED! **ADMIT IT!!!!** :)

Totally joking, btw -- I just love playing Sherlock.

Besides, I have a short list in my mind as to who would be awesome enough to do something like this for me, and her (and your) name is definitely there. So THANK YOU!!!

Qu1nlan: 303 : Haha, your game of Sherlock is awesome.  You should learn to play To Zanarkand! I attempted it a couple weeks ago on my keyboard, ended up giving up. Talent for instruments other than guitar: I haven't got it XD

Seriously though I think everybody on this sub would get you a piano if they could, bro <3

Add me on PSN, then! I'm Yokuo on there, too.

ArtsyKitty: 47 : :D it really is! I'll add you in a little bit! 

Yokuo: 289 : Fantastic! :D

If you end up getting PS+ (worth it, honestly), they're starting to put up two indie games per month that you get to "keep" as long as you claim them and keep PS+. It's a neat way to get more games on the cheap. Plus you need PS+ for online gaming, if that interests you. :P

ArtsyKitty: 115 : I already started the trial and I'm going to get the full year once I get my next paycheck! :D thank you though! :D

Yokuo: 151 : Alright, awesome! Just figured I'd mention it since I wasn't sure it'd be worth it when I got my PS+ (it was). :p

What have you been playing on there?

ArtsyKitty: 211 : thank you! I have been playing the 2 free games that came with the ps+ trial. Then, I just bought outlast! It's downloading now. I am so so so so excited! haha. What are some of your favorites on the ps4 so far?

Yokuo: 513 : Fun! I really like Trine 2, and I'm excited to try the PS4 version. I tried the other game and I wasn't too good at it :p

Contrast is a REALLY cool short indie game that I definitely recommend. Child of Light is supposed to be good also, but I haven't tried it yet.

Knack is a neat platforming game, and you can probably get it on sale for cheapish. I just picked up Watch Dogs but haven't played it yet. And I tried some of Infamous: Second Son and it was really fun! (I hadn't played the older Infamous games)

ArtsyKitty: 314 : I've seen trailers for contrast! I love the art style of it, I definitely want to check it out. I definitely want to check out knack, I think it's still 40 or 50 bucks though. I reaaaaallly want to get the infamous game once I have more money. I ended up just downloading outlast. ohmygod. graphics are so amazing.

Yokuo: 196 : The art style of Contrast is what made me interested in the first place. And the gameplay, while not always totally smooth, is pretty fun. Worth it :)

I haven't played Outlast. Thoughts on it? :)

A_Literally_Penguin: 600 : I️ 100% agree. We need to world to eat little enough meat that it becomes inefficient to factory farm. I️ find it easier for myself to eliminate animal products altogether because it’s easier to define a line of what’s okay and what’s not than only eating meat sometimes.

Usually when talking to people about veganism I️ tell them why I’m veganism and advocate that going vegan is the best but eating less meat is still very good. Doing this I’ve gotten a fair number of people to incorporate a lot of plant based meals into their diet and cut down on their meat intake a lot. 10/10 would recommend.

howlin: 522 : The more strict vegans there are, the more developed the vegan ecosystem becomes. I wouldn't have been able to make the change without the fact that things like Gardein were as cheap as and not to much worse tasting than actual meat. Therefore, hitting a critical mass of vegans in an area is probably more important for conversion than having more part-time omnis.  

But of course you can have both.  In fact, without vegans making the case, I have no idea what would motivate omnis to cut back on their own consumption.

None: 694 : I don't think this is necessarily a good end goal, but I do think it could be a good way to make vegan foods more mainstream. And if people are already used to eating lots of vegan food, it's easier to stop rationalizing your meat habit. 

I'm not sure if there have been any actual studies confirming this, but it seems to be a common theme on r/vegan where people initially do it for health reasons but then become receptive to the ethical/environmental concerns. It's easier to be altruistic when it requires less/no change on your part, hence why most people are vocally against things like trophy hunting and dogfighting but get all huffy when you point out that bacon is equally horrible.

BucketOfChickenBones: 595 : > People are resistant to change.

And people are resistant to convincing.

Here's rule number one for BucketOfChickenBones' approach to animal rights advocacy: the only person that ever convinces you of anything is you.  Our job as advocates isn't to convince anyone of anything but merely to present our case as convincingly as possible.  Then it's up to decent, thinking people to make up their own minds.

Inconsistent arguments aren't convincing.  Saying it's OK to eat meat sometimes during the course of normal life in the 21st century is inconsistent with an acceptance of animal rights.

Uknow_nothing: 1448 : From reading the responses it seems that it always comes down to whether or not you believe that it’s ok that animals be used for human consumption. 

I recently gave up veganism after 8 months free from all animal products. I did it because what I read about(“Eating Animals” was the book) grossed me out. The modern factory farming industry is cruel and gnarly. I also saw truth in the arguments about the environmental impact and health stuff. 

Is it inherently cruel even at small family farms because they still have to kill the animal? To some it will always be seen that way. But to me if an animal that naturally is prey to other species’ has a comfortable, peaceful life free from being chased by coyotes and wolves, it’s perfectly fine that humans(the greatest predator of all time) be allowed to kill and eat them. That’s simply the reality of the world we live in. My problem was always with the conditions depicted. 

So, and this is where my veganism failed: if you’re ok with it- as 99% of people on Earth are- then there are likely going to be times when you’re going to cheat anyway as it’s not a huge moral issue for you. So you might as well live your best life and not beat yourself up to fit into that rigid strict diet. 

Hint: vegans, you’re never going to convince 99% of the world that dogs are the same as cows(unless you’re in China where both are eaten). But you can get them to eat less meat with the other arguments. 

princesscelia: 1142 : Wait, so you gave up veganism because you read a book about the horrors of factory farming and the negative impact of animal agriculture on the environment?!

Killing an animal that didn't want to die is still cruel even if it had a good life. We don't justify murdering people by saying "oh its ok they had a good life". 

Humans aren't the "greatest" predator. We on average run about 10-15 miles an hour, can barely digest raw meat and are vastly ill equiped to rip apart flesh with our hands/teeth. 

There are many reasons people go vegan other than animals. I went vegan almost exclusively because I could see the harm it was doing the environment and then I found out about the horrors of factory farming. I'd hope that more than 99% of the population have basic compassion for animals and can see beyond their own want for animal products.

Approximately 3% of the population in the UK is veggie/vegan so that's already more than 1% and it's on the rise; the amount of vegans has increased [360% in the past 10 years in the UK.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/news/number-of-vegans-in-britain-rises-by-360-in-10-years/).

YaCy14zrzZKJmpt4dYyD: 185 : It certainly helps to be less social / more isolated to reach success on a vegan diet, the way most people are, in my experience.  Food is a big part of social activities and culture.  

Xrystofer: 865 : >Being vegan would take delicious food away from me that brings great joy to my life

Pleasure doesn't justify an action. That is the same as saying that I should rape because I like it.

>and would socially ostracize me as social outings in my region often don't offer vegetarian options, vegan is often unknown.

Inconvenience doesn't justify an action. It's like saying, finding a job is inconvenient, therefore I am going to steal some money.

>In contrast to all this hassle being vegan wouldn't really give me any satisfaction that I can't also reach by making other ethical and environmentally conscious choices

In contrast ceasing my daily rapes would not give me any satisfaction that I can't also reach by making other ethical choices....etc. You do understand that this line of reasoning leads to absurd positions that no sane person would agree, right?

Deinemudda500: 1345 : You're right in all that you say but you are not following that way through yourself. 



You only chose to only apply this way of thinking to food because for you food is not such a big deal.



You're probably not applying it to your cash. Are you giving away all the money that is not necessary for your survival? Just like with foregoing meat to save animals, you can save animals by giving your money away to good causes. Probably a lot more than I would if I skip the little meat that I eat.



Now you will say it's all about doing what's realistically possible, saying you giving away your money is not feasible. But it is. Get rid of your car. Drop fancy makeup or clothes, drop holidays and hobbies. There's lots of inexpensive ways to still amuse yourself while also literally saving lives. You could do so much more. So could I. 



For me cooking, baking and going to fancy food places is my main hobby. I don't have a car, I don't play video games, I won't have children. By doing this, according to this chart https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children I'm doing so much more than a vegan with children. Are you doing all this?

There's an obvious difference between not helping and intentionally causing suffering. With this kind of reasoning we could also justify human murder, ''Well, you do not donate to charity, therefore it is okay to murder people''. Donating money isn't the only way to help by the way. I am here talking to you, you know?
Also, I choosed to apply to other aspects of my life, for example I didn't needlessly kill spiders nor step intentionally on insects, because I understand that their life has value even though it is not equal to my own. I also returned a product that I found out it was made from real leather (some headphones), should have been more careful in the first place though. I even thought of becoming an activist my self, because I do not wish to wait for the world to change by it's self and I would rather do something about it. I am not saying that I am perfect by far, but at least I try to mitigate the suffering that I cause as far as it is practically possible.


>Now you will say it's all about doing what's realistically possible, saying you giving away your money is not feasible. But it is. Get rid of your car.

Nope, not helping is a personal choice, intentionally causing death and suffering is not, big difference. This whole argument is an ad hominem attack, but whatever. The same argument can be made for human murder, you know.

>For me cooking, baking and going to fancy food places is my main hobby. I don't have a car, I don't play video games, I won't have children. By doing this, according to this chart https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children

You can still cook and bake as a vegan, what is the problem? We have so many alternatives to substitute our bad habits. 
You could also adopt if you do not wish to have your own child, that is always an option.

>I'm doing so much more than a vegan with children. Are you doing all this?

Because you are doing X action, that doesn't mean that Y action is excused, imagine if we applied this into human context. You do understand that this is simply an ad hominem attack against myself and not really an argument as to why it is justified to do so needlessly?

>What I'm saying is, no one does everything perfect and everybody feels strongly about a different aspect. Mine is not veganism and that's OK.

No one is perfect. is it okay to maximise and cause intentional suffering then? This line of reasoning is simply terrible if you deconstruct it and apply it in a human context.

Deinemudda500: 521 : You're making a very unfair comparison of equating going out of your way to do something (rape someone) with something that is normal for 99+% of society and pretty innocuous, like eating animal products.

Fundamental difference in our way of thinking. 


It was still an interesting discussion! Thanks mate. I wish you all the best.

Xrystofer: 1472 : >You're making a very unfair comparison of equating going out of your way to do something (rape someone)

You are wrong I didn't not equate it with rape, I am simply saying that the same justification can be applied to different contexts.

Let's say that I told you that it is okay to steal 5 bucks because I like money. Would it be okay to steal 1 million because I like money? Stealing 5 bucks and 1 million is not equal, they are both wrong however.

>with something that is normal for 99+% of society and pretty innocuous, like eating animal products.

Because an action is performed by the majority, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is a right nor just action. Slavery was considered normal at  a time period of our history.

>As the world is today you'll have to put a lot of effort and stress into being vegan and yeah I'm not up for it.

That is like trying to justify an immoral action because of inconvenience. I also do not believe it is much of an inconvenience after you get used to it, at first it definitely is. That always happens when we get outside our comfort zone, doesn't it?

>You obviously think it's the same as murder or rape, I really really don't. Fundamental difference in our way of thinking.

I do not think so,  and this is a strawman. Because something is not equal, doesn't mean that it is moral action.

I do consider killing an animal a lesser offence compared to killing a human, as humans hold more moral value compared to animals.


Deinemudda500: 828 : I see what you mean, I really do. I just disagree. For me eating animal products is just not a greater offence than polluting the world with a car or owning a phone, or wearing clothes that were produced under questionable conditions. 



Some things you can easily not do and it has a great impact, like not driving a gas guzzling monster. I know for you living vegan is not a big deal and you find tasty food and you can bake. I've known vegans, lived with vegetarians and I eat food of both categories. It just does not even come close to some meat and seafood dishes that I enjoy occasionally, and I see no reason to deny myself that. Eating out and going to my work cafeteria where I live would be impossible, and that alone would be such an incredible hassle and extra work in my life that I'm not willing to put up with. 

Xrystofer: 2570 : >I see what you mean, I really do. I just disagree.

This is why we are here for.

>For me eating animal products is just not a greater offence than polluting the world with a car or owning a phone, or wearing clothes that were produced under questionable conditions.

Because action X is a lesser offence than action Y, therefore it is excused/Okay.

Let's see how this argument logically follows if I add humans to this context.

''For me eating Humans is just not a greater offence than polluting the world with a car or owning a phone, or wearing clothes that were produced under questionable conditions.''

Unless you think that there's a difference between animals and humans, that justifies this treatment, your argument could also justify your own murder.

>Some things you can easily not do and it has a great impact, like not driving a gas guzzling monster.

You can also very easily not purchase animal products, you go to the supermarket and you pick the almond, soy, hazelnut or quinoa milk instead.

>I know for you living vegan is not a big deal and you find tasty food and you can bake.

It's not hard to replace delicious food with other delicious food, I actually enjoy my food more now since I can eat as much as I want and not restrict my self.

>I know for you living vegan is not a big deal and you find tasty food and you can bake. I've known vegans, lived with vegetarians and I eat food of both categories. It just does not even come close to some meat and seafood dishes that I enjoy occasionally, and I see no reason to deny myself that.

Well, there is obviously a lot of reasons,

1) Health

2) Environment, why should what you eat effect me personally when you can easily eat something else? I want to live till I am 100+ and not die prematurely because greedy people could not stop their addictions and caused life on our planet to die. If you think that I am exaggerating, check out this article. http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-commentary/commentary/if-the-ocean-dies-we-all-die.html

3) Since animals do not wish to die because they are sentient like yourself, you are inconsistent to deny them of their right to life since you have other options readily available.

>Eating out and going to my work cafeteria where I live would be impossible, and that alone would be such an incredible hassle and extra work in my life that I'm not willing to put up with.

Loads of places have vegan options and the options increase as we increase, veganism is an explosive movement and inconvenience doesn't really justify taking someone's life.


Deinemudda500: 1313 : I don't want to live to 100, not even close tbh. I value quality over quantity and quality is a big point for me. We're not going to agree that vegan food is as delicious as noon vegan food, it's a matter of opinion. I've had vegan food, plenty, and while some can be good, it's not satisfying for me. So many flavors are missing, I don't even know where to start. Bloody steak, fresh grilled shrimps, creamy ice cream, fried chicken, etc. I do often read the vegan subreddit when it pops up on the front page and 80% of the food just looks sad to me. I'm not trying to be mean here. I've known only a handful of vegans but they all returned to meat or to vegetarian and they told me they missed the good food. Hell, I even did a year of vegetarian just to try it and back then I lived in a big metropolitan area so I could at least get some choice of vegetarian food. It was a good experience because it made me realise just what a luxury meat is and now I eat better meat and more consciously.


I just don't see eating animal products as something as horrible as you do. I think we've turned into a circular discussion here. I respect what you do but I'm not going to become a vegan. It still helps me though to know more about vegans so that when I meet them I can be empathetic with them. So thanks for that!

Xrystofer: 2391 : >I don't want to live to 100, not even close tbh.

That is not what I said. I said that I want to live and not die prematurely because people didn't stop their destructive behaviour.

>I value quality over quantity and quality is a big point for me.

Veganism gives you both, not only you will live longer, you will also be healthier.

>I've had vegan food, plenty, and while some can be good, it's not satisfying for me. So many flavors are missing, I don't even know where to start.

We have ice cream, protein extracts, milk and cheese. What is the problem? Don't you think that it is extremely selfish to put your taste buds above the life of others?

>I'm not trying to be mean here. I've known only a handful of vegans but they all returned to meat or to vegetarian and they told me they missed the good food.

It's not food, it's violence and you are literally eating someone.

>Hell, I even did a year of vegetarian just to try it and back then I lived in a big metropolitan area so I could at least get some choice of vegetarian food. It was a good experience because it made me realise just what a luxury meat is and now I eat better meat and more consciously.

A luxury that comes at the price of the environment, your health, humans and animals alike.

>I just don't see eating animal products as something as horrible as you do.

Have you ever suffered? Imagine being born, lived and died at the extreme conditions that animals are forced to endure. Put your self in those conditions, ask yourself if you would accept the same treatment and not say that it is something absolutely evil to put a sentient being through so that you can have 5 minutes of pleasure versus your whole life.

>I think we've turned into a circular discussion here.

I am trying to demonstrate the consistent logic of your own argumentation. 

>I respect what you do but I'm not going to become a vegan. It still helps me though to know more about vegans so that when I meet them I can be empathetic with them. So thanks for that!

There is nothing respectable about being a vegan, the same way that there's nothing respectable about not raping, not stealing and not murdering humans.

Deinemudda500: 492 : Sorry dude but just no. Raping an actual human is not in the same ball park as eating animal products. You vegans who say insane shit like this are a minuscule minority, how do you not realise how detached you sound?

Or one of those thedonald posters who makes up insane inside lingo to wank each other off cause they don't eat chicken tendies anymore. Just a comparison, bro! 

Xrystofer: 629 : >Lol you just call everyone intellectually dishonest because you can't accept that most people don't agree with you. 

Again, it's not an equation, it is a comparison. Let me make a demonstration.

I killed 1 guy in self defence, therefore it is justified. 
I killed 10 guys in self defence, therefore it is justified.

The logical structure remains the same, but they are not equal and by your logic they cannot be compared.

>Hell, in your logic 99.9% of the world is intellectually dishonest.

Deinemudda500: 249 : You could sacrifice a mere tenth of your salary by just giving up a minimum of luxury. For me that's easier than taking basically all the tasty food out of my life. We have different priorities, mine is good food, yours is cash. And that's okay imo.

I went about a week of eating pretty much just rice before I caved and started eating meat again. Right now, being vegan just isn't an option for me, unless I want to constantly feel like I'm being stabbed in the gut.

skyelbow: 317 : I have cystic       fibrosis, which often causes fat malabsorption. Although CF varies from person to person, I've notice for me, I digest very little fat from plants like peanuts and avocados, but I don't have much problems digesting fats from fatty meats like fish. 

Your sources study correlation, not causation. 

swimviking: 496 : I have noticed that when donating plasma first thing in the morning (fasted) I could end up being turned away as lipemic if I ate nuts, peanut butter, avocado or other higher fat foods the night before. but I could eat two pounds of steak, sides of bacon and more but would not show as lipemic in the morning. back before I went keto I wondered if there was some reason those other fats aren’t handled by our bodies as well. Now I am mostly carnivorous and it is not an issue. donations go well.

greatbooks28: 827 : Mild cystic fibrosis is not a disease, it is referred to as atypical cystic fibrosis, the onset of symptoms milder than that of typical cystic fibrosis but during adulthood. Cystic fibrosis is a life limiting disease with a horribly long list of organs affected that then of course require medical treatment, including the dreaded pharmaceuticals. Source: I trained as a doctor. 
My professional opinion is that you dread getting officually diagnosed because there's nothing to find. And your obvious disdain for real cystic fibrosis sufferers who rely on an abundance of "death chemicals" indicates your lack of need for medication. Because you don't have atypical cystic fibrosis, or mild, or anything cystic fibrosis. Get yourself some help for the parts of your body that clearly do need to be called in for some attention.

skyelbow: 772 : > Cystic fibrosis is a life limiting disease with a horribly long list of organs affected that then of course require medical treatment, including the dreaded pharmaceuticals

The list of affected organs is not a "long list", only affects: lungs, digestive system, sweat glans, and if you are male, reproductive system.

What are you talking about? I health has drastically improved after I stopped listening to doctors and started learning about actual nutrition.

greatbooks28: 270 : Dude either get a medical degree, a decent doctor or a life. Either one of those should fix your "problem". In all seriousness though I worry for your mental health in this, looking through your post history there is a pattern of hypochondriosis. Take care of yourself.

I mean you have to decide for yourself; luckily you probably have a nutrionist who you can talk with about things like this!

Mhm, so we make a study about diet related illnesses and the very strong correlation should not be causal one?

Except from that we generally speak of a causality if we have constantly a correlation and a hypothesis that A causes B, which we can then also observe. We can actually do this here:

> Several proposed mechanisms may explain the lower risks for some diseases exhibited by vegans compared to lacto-ovo-vegetarians. It is well established that obesity is a major risk factor for CVD [43,44,45,46] and cancer [47,48,49,50,51]. Significantly lower mean BMI observed in vegans may be an important factor for reducing risks from heart disease and CVD mortality [36]. Nutrient profiles of the vegetarian dietary patterns may explain cardiovascular risks reduction [29]. Dietary fibers, folate, antioxidants, and phytochemicals rich in fruits and vegetables [52,53], whole grains, soy, and nuts [54,55,56] are associated with low level of serum cholesterol [57], lower trans/saturated fat, lower incidence of diabetes [58], CVD [59], and specific cancers [60], and lower mortality incidence from stroke and IHD [61]. Other published studies of vegetarians also found that vegans are thinner [62], have lower LDL and total cholesterol [63] than lacto-ovo-vegetarians, among whites and African Americans [64]. Similarly, among Latin Americans, vegans have lower plasma lipids than lacto-ovo-vegetarians and omnivores [65]. Vinagre et al. [66] showed that vegan diets improved metabolic pathways of cholesterol remnant removal from circulation.



skyelbow: 145 : > Significantly lower mean BMI observed in vegans

These are bad things when it comes to CF. Thanks for proving my point.

That seems to be what you're saying. If the issue you're bringing up is that being thin is bad the solution is to eat more calories, but your making that sound impossible on a plant based diet. If you can't get extra calories from plants you must only be able to get them from meat. 

skyelbow: 321 : It would be nice if you had a basic understanding of nutrition before you post. It is not just about calories, the different macronutrients are digested differently in the body. Sugars and carbs from plants are easy to digest and I don't have problems with them. But you can't live without fat, so I get my fat from Meat.

Best wishes.

Xrystofer: 631 : >I honestly don’t care enough about animals to change my lifestyle, I don’t value their life.


Is it okay to kill humans if I do not value their life? 
The fact that you do not care is irrelevant, you have a moral obligation to not cause unnecessary harm since you possess moral agency.

>However I fully support any campaign that seeks the better treatment of animals, just because we are going to kill, cook and eat a chicken doesn’t mean we should allow it to live in absolutely abhorrent conditions.

If there's no need for moral consideration regarding their life, why would you care about their welfare in the first place? 


SilentmanGaming: 501 : It's not about if you care about them, it's about having morals and staying consistent with them.

I don't care about whomever living a million miles away from me but that doesn't mean it's ok for me to pay for their killing either.

If you want to give yourself moral consideration based on your sentience and capacity to suffer, then you need do the same for all beings with sentience and capacity to suffer.

Otherwise you are just arbitrarily assigning and removing morals from whomever you choose

Jus10Crummie: 339 : Are chickens self aware? Im not sure killing a chicken is any different than harvesting a plant. It is interesting to see the evolution of a species and how its longevity has been ensured because its predator benefits the most from it reproducing. Thats all any species purpose is, reproduction and longevity, humans aren't any different. 

SilentmanGaming: 1028 : Would you be ok being killed by another being because they weren't sure that killing you was any different than harvesting a plant?

Sounds like you are doubling down into solipsism instead of accepting that you can (and people have) reasonably conclude that other beings are or aren't sentient.  I don't think there is any controversy over whether or not a chicken is sentient. Your own skepticism over that fact is due to your own lack of research on the subject so it wouldn't really be in good spirit to continue and hinge your argument on that.

Also, just to make sure I've touched on this, saying "every species purpose is just reproduction and longevity, including humans" doesn't make much sense to me. I get what you are saying, but I'm not sure how it's an argument. If anything you are actually drawing humans and animals closer together as being even more similar.  Also, I think that quote is a very watered down and cynical way to view life. An analogy would be "all Mario is is a game about jumping over bricks" 

Jus10Crummie: 292 : You would eat another human if you had to, starvation is a bitch. You wouldn't know, nor I. Less said, reproduction is life. Chickens have ensured their species survival (not through any one being) by being favored. Top of the food chain. You get rich by the rich. Fuck for purpose type stuff

SilentmanGaming: 1174 : >You would eat another human if you had to, starvation is a bitch.

You've changed the scenario completely. This says nothing about the morals of eating a person.

Let's try playing your game to show you how it doesn't work.
Here's and example:
It is justified to kill a person in self defense, therefore it is justified to kill people.

You are trying to use the context of survival to justify any killing in any context.

>reproduction is life

Again, this is just cynical and purposely diluted. I'll return to my Mario analogy "Mario was nothing but jumping over bricks". An obvious over simplification.

>Chickens have ensured their species survival (not through any one being) by being favored.

Im not sure what you are saying here, are you suggesting chickens being eaten by people is beneficial for chickens because they are bred?

>Top of the food chain.

Not an argument as this says nothing about morality. Just because we can kill and eat something doesn't mean we should. I shouldn't have to describe morals to you.

> Fuck for purpose type stuff

Ok, even for arguments sake we accept that life is about reproduction, how exactly does this justify eating meat?

Jus10Crummie: 17 : Im drunk its late

SilentmanGaming: 22 : Alright man, take care

FruitdealerF: 132 : Do you know what kind of practices happen in the dairy industry? Are you okay with the reproductive systems of cows being exploited?

I_am_legend-ary: 88 : I admit I’m probably pretty ignorant to this, but then again I don’t eat dairy products 

GoOtterGo: 292 : Out of curiosity, when/how did slaughter become a different moral subject than treatment and held to a different standard for you? As someone who ate meat for 30 years even I recognized slaughter is very much an aspect of 'absolutely abhorrent conditions'. I just tried to not think about it.

I_am_legend-ary: 324 : It’s because I’m fully ok with killing an animal, especially if that animal has been bred for food.

If you cause something unneeded suffering whist it’s alive that is cruel, their is no benefit to treating them cruelly. 

However if you end the animals life as quick and painlessly as possible there is no unnecessary pain 

GoOtterGo: 423 : So your concern with animal welfare is that there is no benefit (presumably to you, or your product) through harm, but killing an animal, which arguably is the paramount of harm, is acceptable because it does result in benefit through them becoming product to you?

Would you see this perspective of valuable harm be able to be applied to humans, as animals? Perhaps ones bred unintelligent enough to not converse argument?

nezrock: 128 : That's not the same, because we don't eat humans. They aren't bred for food, so there's no reason to kill them for that purpose.

Jus10Crummie: 129 : Its going to die regardless, im not even sure if a chicken is self aware anyway so hows it any different than harvesting a plant?

GoOtterGo: 1212 : The argument that it's going to die regardless applies to all life, though. You and I are going to die regardless, so why not make use of our meat now? We're all walking resources going to spoil, aren't we?

The argument against it is, obviously, like us, the chicken has the intelligence to not want to be killed and a complex set of emotions. That, like us, wants to live out its own life. [It's capacity for this has been studied](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-startling-intelligence-of-the-common-chicken1/), all sentient species have this intelligent and emotional capacity. So the position vegans put forward is: should all sentients who have this capacity have the same rights to independent agency as we humans give ourselves? We already give it to many certain species, just culturally not those we've been raised to see as food animals.

I mean even if you don't care about the ultimate end for other sentient species, you might think veganism would help you with alleviating the conditions through which meat is made. You said you'd rather not see these animals live through abhorrent conditions to become food, [but that's how they live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE9l94b3x9U).

Jus10Crummie: 839 : Your link leads to broken webpage. We do use our meat while we're young we have the ability to do work, how many 60 year olds do you see just now entering the work force. That is the same as harvesting a chicken for food at the right time. As far as the bird fighting for its life, EVERY living thing does that, even the bacteria that causes the flu will flee from white blood cells. Its the most basic instinct in living creatures, that and reproduction. Whatever complex emotions a chicken can possess would have to have evolved from a survival need somewhere along the line, the study of evolution is more extensively studied than whether or not a chicken is self aware. Even plants have evolved to ensure its longevity such as deeper root systems, and a wider spead of seeds. Imo there is no difference in harvesting a plant or animal.

GoOtterGo: 560 : Okay, I rescind my approach to this debate, maybe you don't understand what sentience means. Without having to get into it on brain stems and temporal function, and why plants and bacteria don't have them, we're likely going to have to agree to disagree. Most humans don't see animals and plants as the same thing, evolutionarily, biologically or otherwise past the 1700s. There's a reason animal rights as a legal framework were created.

The idea that chickens being involuntarily killed for food is the same as 60-year-old humans retiring is absurd at best.

Meatball-Magnus: 169 : A chicken unattended would be mauled within the first couple of days in the wild LMAO, if we didn't breed and protect them I could see the species going extinct in time.

GoOtterGo: 301 : ... That post is three months old, son; what were you diggin' for?

But you're right, current-stock broilers are unable to breed naturally, they'd die if not kept alive artificially for food. I hope the irony of 'they'd be killed in the wild if we didn't kill them for food' isn't lost on you, though.

Meatball-Magnus: 201 : Oh the irony isnt lost but I put our species above others so it's better for us to eat it than some other animal in my opinion. Also I only found out about this sub today so I just sorted through best.

Calackyo: 1142 : I know this is weeks old by now, but your question "should all sentients who have this capacity have the same rights to independent agency as we humans give ourselves?"

I just wanted to address the fact that in law, rights go hand in hand with responsibilities. That is, you only have your rights (e.g. freedom of movement) if you stick to your responsibilities in society (e.g. obeying the laws). So there are cases where we take away peoples right to freedom, by sending them to prison, because they didn't keep up with their responsibilities in obeying the law. 

Now my point is: if you're saying that animals should have the same rights as humans, then i would say they should have all of the same responsibilities as humans. This includes obeying laws, paying taxes etc. now obviously this is unpracticable, because animals don't have the ability to hold up their end of the bargain. 

Now this may seem unfair, but we treat humans who can't maintain their responsibilites in a similar way, by taking away their rights. Even mentally ill humans who have zero ability to keep up their responsibilities have their rights taken from them.

SevFTW: 988 : I'm just browsing through this thread from /top/ and wanted to reply to this.

> I just wanted to address the fact that in law, rights go hand in hand with responsibilities. That is, you only have your rights (e.g. freedom of movement) if you stick to your responsibilities in society (e.g. obeying the laws).

I've been living in Germany for a while now, and this is actually something I really admire. The idea is that rights are rights and cannot, in any case, be taken away.

For example you have the right to freedom, even while in prison. In Germany it is not illegal to break out of prison and you cannot have your sentence increased because of it, because the Grundgesetz (Fundamental Law) believes that every person has the desire to be free, and you cannot be prosecuted for that desire.

The legal system kinda fucks with it, in that they'll charge you for theft of the uniform and destruction of public property if you break out. But I still think it's an interesting concept.

GoOtterGo: 2255 : Yeah this is a dead soy-based horse, son.

So there are cases where we take away peoples right to freedom, by sending them to prison, because they didn't keep up with their responsibilities in obeying the law.

This isn't true, rights and laws are legally independent and [in most modern countries] you don't lose basic human rights by disobeying laws. You may lose your freedom of mobility as you said, but this restriction is more in context that you're seen by said country to be of risk to yourself or others, and prisons are still legally bound to offer a degree of mobility freedom with yard time, workshop access, cafeteria/library access, etc. On the other hand individuals could do literally anything within society and never be denied the right to basic health (food, sleep, sanitation), basic legal access, and in many countries the right to work, visitation rights, etc, etc. Even the worst criminal has the legal right to bring to court a warden who abuses them and in doing so limiting their basic human rights.

Beyond prisoner rights however, even those who arguably contribute no functional responsibilities (infants) or violate lesser responsibilities (kids skateboarding on private property) don't waiver any personal rights as a result.

That's half the point of human rights, that they're unwaiverable.

>Now my point is: if you're saying that animals should have the same rights as humans, then i would say they should have all of the same responsibilities as humans. This includes obeying laws, paying taxes etc. now obviously this is unpracticable, because animals don't have the ability to hold up their end of the bargain.

I feel these following arguments are moot given the premise that rights aren't granted only through legal responsibility.

Calackyo: 2986 : You make a very fair argument,  so I'll drop the rights vs responsibilities spiel.  

However,  to elaborate upon my argument,  with the knowledge that rights and responsibilities arent technically legally linked,  I would ask the same question without the technicalities:

if animals deserve the same rights as humans,  should we not also expect the same standards of behaviour?  

Because even if they arent technically linked,  I personally believe that the reason we have unwaivable human rights is because we believe that humans deserve them,  so I would like you to show your reasoning for why animals are just as deserving. 

My reasoning for why humans deserve them whilst animals dont is that all humans have the possibility of changing the world (on an individual scale, such as one inventor being capable of saving millions of lives)  in ways that no other animals are capable of. I also personally believe that humans as a species are capable of transcending not only our planet,  but the physical realm entirely (in a digital sense,  not spiritual) and that no other animal has shown an ability for this either,  and since we are capable of such greatness I believe that makes us special (but we are still definitely animals,  I am not saying that we are in any way superior,  but we are certainly unique as a species on earth) 

Furthermore I would actually make the very unpopular argument that humans as a whole are far more compassionate than most other species'.  If you think about 99% of other predators,  how many of them would feel any sort of empathy at all towards an animal of another species?  I have personally felt empathy towards things that dont even exist (fictional stories) ,  and there is simply no evidence to suggest that animals are capable of such an amount of empathy,  most of them arent even capable of comprehending the things that I feel empathy towards. Can you name another apex predator that has tamed and cared for another predator species,  like we have with dogs?  Can you name another species that cares about animals simply because each species is unique and therefore beautiful?  Can you name another species that has members spend years of their lives training to treat the injured and dying members of other species of animals?  You yourself are proof of the compassion of humanity,  you care so much about animals that you are willing to change your lifestyle in order to help them,  I can't think of any other animal on the planet that changes its diet for ethical reasons. I certainly know of no other animals that have debates amongst themselves about ethics,  or morality,  or laws. 


Finally,  in your previous comment you mentioned how animals of a certain sentience deserved rights,  I would like to know what your parameters for sentience are,  and how you determine at what point a sentient creature deserves rights. 

Thanks for taking the time to talk with me and also for not calling me a murderer for my curiosity. 



GoOtterGo: 4964 : > if animals deserve the same rights as humans, should we not also expect the same standards of behaviour?

But again, we don't even expect these behavioural standards amongst humans to guarantee them rights. The shittiest person on earth has unwaiverable rights in most countries. So to argue other sentient species should only get similar rights if they adhere to a certain behavioural standard isn't a fair benchmark.

> Because even if they arent technically linked, I personally believe that the reason we have unwaivable human rights is because we believe that humans deserve them, so I would like you to show your reasoning for why animals are just as deserving.

We believe humans deserve them not because of their behaviour, though, but because of their sentience. Humans' ability to think abstractly, feel sympathy, and have the cognitive ability to consider pain are what drove us to the concept of rights and them being unwaivering. We don't give people rights because they're helpful or kind, we give them rights because we sympathize with pain and anguish. At least with other humans, culturally.

Rights aren't a matter of utility, either. You aren't given a right because you have the capacity to do great things, you're given them because we as a sentient being recognize a degree of life quality should be respected for everyone. A baseline standard for those who recognize what a baseline is. A human born as an intellectual vegetable is granted equal rights to those you would consider far more utilitarianly capable.

Even now certain sentient species have minimal laws that protect them, though. [Pet animals](https://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/animal-welfare-act-quick-reference-guides) have housing and care standards, which come with jailable punishments if they're not adhered to, and there has even been [legal action filed over Habeas Corpus](https://www.nonhumanrights.org/blog/media-release-12-2-13/) amongst captive chimpanzees.

But food animals fall under the legal category of CFE (Common Farming Exemptions), which it can be summed up as 'if it's common industry practice, even if it's inhumane by animal rights laws, it's legal'. You'd do well to read more on the subject, https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/some-animals-are-more-equal-than-others/

>... there is simply no evidence to suggest that animals are capable of such an amount of empathy...

This is a long disputed claim by current research standards, and current thinking argues other sentient animals are capable of emotional (and empathetic) capacity similar to humans, and across many different taxonomies (mammals, birds, mollusc, etc.),

The argument you're making here is for veganism, not against it in most of our eyes. The argument that we're unique in our capacity to be empathetic, so we shouldn't apply that capacity towards other similarly-sentient species because they cannot, denies us of that same capacity.

> Finally, in your previous comment you mentioned how animals of a certain sentience deserved rights, I would like to know what your parameters for sentience are, and how you determine at what point a sentient creature deserves rights.

[Self-awareness and consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness) is usually the scientific baseline for sentience, and there are many research tests currently used to gauge for this ability. As for a benchmark for 'deserves rights', typically 'is the animal cognizant of harm, and will it actively and intently avoid being exposed to it' is how it's interpreted amongst vegans and animal rights frameworks.

> Thanks for taking the time to talk with me and also for not calling me a murderer for my curiosity. 

Don't sweat it. I have nothing against you, this is just a discussion of conflicting worldviews and beliefs. You're entitled to yours, even if I disagree with them, and hopefully we both take a degree of introspection from the interaction.

Calackyo: 3273 : 





>Humans' ability to think abstractly, feel sympathy, and have the cognitive ability to consider pain are what drove us to the concept of rights and them being unwaivering

I see what you mean here, but i do not see how the same things apply to *all* animals, you must certainly agree with me that a shrimp cannot think abstractly, or that most creatures without a cerebral cortex cannot do anything anywhere near those that do in the cognitive sense. 

My main personal reasoning against blanket veganism is that there must be a cut-off point, i certainly agree that there are many animal species out there that are capable of feeling suffering, and for the most part i avoid these meats (i detest pork for that reason, despite its taste). 

Similarly i would never in my life condone the harming of an animal that has been proven to think abstractly, such as apes or elephants. However, i do not believe at all that say, a trout has anywhere near the capacity for suffering that a cat does. Fish are a good example in general, we know they swim away from pain, and predators, but at what point does something stop being an instinct and start being a cognitive choice to preserve ones' life? There are microscopic organisms that use their flagellum to move away from harmful elements, but i wouldn't expect you to argue that they are sentient.

If the only criteria is that it shows aversion to harm, then i would argue that there are many plants that do the same, many grasses send chemical signals that there are herbivores around, there are plants that will even move to protect themselves when touched (thigmonasty). Are these also all not signs that there is a living being that does not wish to die? You could argue that these plants do not have a brain and are therefore not capable of suffering, but we know that body parts severed from a creature will still display movement, a fishes lower half might still swim, but it is not consciously swimming away from danger, it is just a mechanical response. At that point then that lower-half-of-fish is no longer sentient, and must then be okay to eat?

 There must be a point at which that cut-off exists between cognitive survival behaviour and automatic mechanical responses to stimuli, and i personally believe that the cut-off is somewhere within the animal kingdom. 

> The argument you're making here is for veganism, not against it in most of our eyes. The argument that we're unique in our capacity to be empathetic, so we shouldn't apply that capacity towards other similarly-sentient species because they cannot, denies us of that same capacity.

This is a very good point, I have no rebuttal for that. I was expecting you to reject my idea that humans are compassionate, which is the only answer i've ever gotten for that viewpoint of mine. This is actually the most convincing argument i've ever heard for veganism, and i guess i already knew it, so thanks for showing me that. Not that i'm immediately converted, but gosh darn this is gonna be ruminated upon.

I do still believe that human lives are more important than animal lives, however i am freely willing to admit that this might be entirely emotional, and my arguments of what humans can achieve may just be rationalisations of my emotions.


GoOtterGo: 5974 : >I see what you mean here, but i do not see how the same things apply to all animals, you must certainly agree with me that a shrimp cannot think abstractly,

We would need to define 'abstractly', but there's no [current] evidence that shrimp are capable of contemplating self-awareness and, through that, selflessness like mammals can. Crustaceans are an interesting subject because there is still little study on their capacity compared to invertebrates, and [have been studied to exhibit stress-like behaviour](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6189/1293) similar to emotions in humans.

>... or that most creatures without a cerebral cortex cannot do anything anywhere near those that do in the cognitive sense. 

>My main personal reasoning against blanket veganism is that there must be a cut-off point, i certainly agree that there are many animal species out there that are capable of feeling suffering, and for the most part i avoid these meats (i detest pork for that reason, despite its taste). 

There is typically a cut-off point, and that's the capacity for suffering. Brain stems and central-nervous systems are usually the physical minimums required for [current] classification of suffering, so that is usually the cut-off point for vegans. Because of this many vegans take no issue with consuming Oysters and Mussels,

http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2010/04/consider_the_oyster.html

https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/

>However, i do not believe at all that say, a trout has anywhere near the capacity for suffering that a cat does. Fish are a good example in general, we know they swim away from pain, and predators, but at what point does something stop being an instinct and start being a cognitive choice to preserve ones' life? There are microscopic organisms that use their flagellum to move away from harmful elements, but i wouldn't expect you to argue that they are sentient.

The dividing point is whether or not the aversion of harm is cognizant or reflexive. If there is an emotional component post-harm. [Fish have comparable capacity for suffering that cats do](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201406/fish-are-sentient-and-emotional-beings-and-clearly-feel-pain), as they have both brain stems and central nervous systems. Fish however [have been in debate in their ability to feel pain](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-bekoff/fish-feel-pain_b_8881656.html) in the same capacity as humans (there is no argument that they don't at all), and while researchers generally agree they're capable to similar capacity, a few argue otherwise. Of course fish have [exhibited [subjectively] high intelligence](https://www.popsci.com/article/science/are-fish-intelligent-crows-chimps-or-people), so the argument that they don't feel pain isn't a popular opinion amongst researchers at present. We place [fish under anesthesia](https://wiki.med.umich.edu/display/ULAMGSOP/Guidelines+on+Fish+Anesthesia+Analgesia+and+Surgery) when performing surgery.

Of course vegans typically error on the side of caution. So if something may be capable of understanding pain, best to not chance it until it's proven one way or another. [This is why bees](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/bees-can-train-each-other-to-use-tools/)/honey is typically non-vegan.

And no, nobody's arguing microbes and the like are sentient. Vegans don't avoid single-cell organisms or anything of the like. They have no brain stem, no central-nervous systems, and are entirely driven by chemical responses and basic stimuli. They're entirely unlike animals in this regard.

>If the only criteria is that it shows aversion to harm, then i would argue that there are many plants that do the same, many grasses send chemical signals that there are herbivores around, there are plants that will even move to protect themselves when touched (thigmonasty). Are these also all not signs that there is a living being that does not wish to die? You could argue that these plants do not have a brain and are therefore not capable of suffering, but we know that body parts severed from a creature will still display movement, a fishes lower half might still swim, but it is not consciously swimming away from danger, it is just a mechanical response. At that point then that lower-half-of-fish is no longer sentient, and must then be okay to eat?

Again, this requires clarity between intentful response and reflex. Plants don't 'avert from harm', they simply have developed capacity to react to damage at a chemical level. They have no brain stem, they have no central-nervous system, so their responses aren't held to the same emotional capacity as sentient animals. There is also the post-harm capacity that we're talking about. Once harmed a sentient animal will consider the harm, have an emotional-behavioral response, remember the source and pattern its future behaviour around it. Plants do not have this upper-brain capacity, and simply react to stimuli.

But you are correct in that the dividing line between sentient and non-sentient is still messy for some taxonomies, and some people divide their personal relationships with other sentients along different lines than others. Pescetarians consider themselves vegetarian, but still eat fish. Ostrovegans, mentioned above, consider themselves vegan but still eat Oysters/Mussels. Some vegans eat honey, some don't. It's not a universally defined line. But research is constantly exposing more and more intellectual and emotional similarities between human and non-human animals. I'm sure you've seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INa-oOAexno) recently, or [others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZPZD1JV5QQ&t=3m36s), as objective demonstrations of sentience amongst non-human animals. Even if you don't agree all non-human animals are capable of this, even Chimps don't have the basic rights vegans would like them to have.

Calackyo: 733 : Your point about the post-harm capacity does help me there with the distinction between plants/animals.  It also surprises me to learn that some vegans consider oysters as vegan. 

Thank you very much for this discussion,  I have learned a lot and there is clearly more research I need to do. If there were more people like you,  (not just vegans)  who were able to patiently explain and discuss with a wildly contradictory viewpoint,  the world would be a better place.  You have yourself a good day.  

EDIT: those two chimp videos are truly beautiful,  I would say that is far more than proof of sentience,  but proof of personhood (in the vein of humanity,  only inclusive of the other animals capable of it)  :)  truly amazing. 

GoOtterGo: 563 : No worries, you as well. Thanks for sticking around and not just downvoting and fucking off. Folks (including vegans and sometimes myself) are guilty of that. I also appreciate your perspective on things because frankly we can all be limited by our vacuums sometimes. It helps with remaining objective.

I should also apologize for some of my phrasing, I think I come off hostile or short but I don't meant to. Vegans just defend the same perspectives over and over, so after a while we get less courteous. It's why vegans get called assholes so often, I imagine.

notinteresting0: 493 : The health rational doesn't make too much sense to me. I get bombarded with nutrition facts.org, random  blog articles, crazy netflix documentaries. The government resources have conflicting studies. No one does any repetition studies because there's a lack of funding. Therefore, I find it easier to concentrate on eating less rather than what I'm eating. Every vegan arguement can also be made for over consumption.

Tldr: I focus on eating less rather than the substance of what I'm eating.

YaCy14zrzZKJmpt4dYyD: 1094 : I recommend finding doctors you trust who evaluate the studies.  I can tell you that when I went on a plant based diet, I lowered my total cholesterol value from 190, near high, to 131, what some cardiologists consider 'heart attack proof', in 12 weeks. My primary care doctor stated it usually takes 2 statins to get the cholesterol that low.  Statins have very serious side effects and their impact on mortality is limited.

Although I am one person, I did it because I saw doctors who presented the research showing cholesterol gets lowered on this diet dramatically.  So many decades of consistent, well designed and conducted studies have shown the saturated fat-cholesterol link.  

It's interesting to learn about how studies are measured against each other.  One of the ways is to listen and read doctors who read huge amounts of scientific literature, and understand the biases, including the doctor's bias.

drmcdougall.com has pretty good articles with a wide array of scientific references.  Sure, it's one point of view but it's a starting point.  It's all free stuff.
Best wishes.

jsb501: 577 : Can't the same be said for vegetables? They are living organisms and we harvest, kill, and eat them also. Why am I not vegan because without a good steak, bacon, lamb, duck, deer, etc. every few days my life would be a living hell. There is a thing called the food chain every thing has its place and everything eats according to their hierarchy on that. Is what we do worse or better than what it is in the wild where lions, alligators may cause more pain to the animal than humans with our tools that we use to make sure that they die quickly with as little pain as possible?

Lapster69: 1556 : 1. Plants don't have a brain or a nervous system, it's physically impossible for them to be harmed in the same way that animals and fish can be harmed. Killing animals and plants isn't comparable.

2. I know of people who also loved meat but went vegan, it's not as hard as you'd think. If your life genuinely isn't worth living without animal products then you've probably got some personal issues to be dealing with.

3. Humans are at the top of the food chain and are more powerful than cows and pigs etc, but does that mean that we *have* to inflict suffering on them when we can easily avoid doing so? Just because we can harm others doesn't justify it. Might doesn't make right. 

4. We shouldn't base our behaviour on the behaviour of wild predators for 2 reasons. Firstly, they live in a totally different context to us. They are usually obligate carnivores so they would die without meat, unlike humans who can be healthy as vegans. As well as this, they have no agriculture so their only source of food is to kill others, unlike us because we can choose to just eat plants. Finally, do we really want to be basing our moral code on the actions of animals? New male lions entering a pride will often kill the previous dominant male, his children, and then rape the female that gave birth to them. If I went into someones house, killed the husband and children and then raped the wife saying 'oh but lions do it' wouldn't be a valid justification. (Btw I'm not comparing the two acts, I'm just using an analogy to show why the reasoning is flawed).

Jus10Crummie: 231 : Bacon, filet mignon, and shell fish. Nothing on earth can get remotely close to the flavor of bacon, the heartiness of filet, or the delicacy of bottom feeding crustaceans. I enjoy all things but I will never give up sex, or these.

YaCy14zrzZKJmpt4dYyD: 884 : Many feel tastes are acquired.  When people switch cultures, many times they have no problem at all changing their foods, at least over time.  I'm sure they thought it was weird at first.  I haven't had meat, dairy or any oils added in over 6 months now.  It wasn't too big of a problem because I already ate a lot of rice on occasion.  I eat huge amounts of bread, rice, and potatoes, and it's fully satisfying to me.  I also felt exactly the way you describe, initially.  I no longer do. 

The taste of a properly made hot, moist and freshly baked loaf of whole wheat bread is phenomenal.

I regularly get 65-80 grams of protein and 2100 calories in starches, but have other things like spinach, Chia seeds for nutrition.  

I challenge you to pretend, for the sake of curiosity and knowledge, that certain vegan foods can taste as good and attempt it for maybe a couple of weeks.  

Jus10Crummie: 2132 : Yeah, thats not gonna happen for me. My family up in Ohio are all pig farmers so I get basically free unlimited pork. I usually come home with a cooler full of unsmoked uncut pork bellies and smoke them myself or braise them with some brown sugar and liquid smoke and make little cubes of bacon for all my family and friends here in town. And every summer I'm in FL at my mothers beach house so we charter deep sea fishing trips and catch on average 300 lbs of fish (grouper, cobia, snapper, and mahi) and live on that all summer long. I challenge you to find a better, fresher, or more enjoyable meal than catching a fish in the middle of the ocean then taking it home, filleting it just before putting it on a charcoal grill on the beach. Its about the pursuit of pleasure, I don't intend on wasting my life on unnecessary restrictions such as veganism. My grandmother (who lives on the pig farm) is in her 90s still going strong has probably ate meat with 95% of her meals her entire life. If things are done in moderation (over-eating) then you can be perfectly healthy for a very long time. And as far as the morality of it, it's all self perceived. When I was young I would play with the little piglets they were so cute, and would ask "are the going to be killed?" I was explained not until they are older and fully grown, then was taken to the slaughterhouse to watch them do it. Quick and painless and straight to the point, my first time watching it (as a child) I remember being grossed out and not sure how to feel about it. Until i saw them take the carcass to processing and saw all the different cuts of meat I've been eating come to fruition (we had fresh tenderloin that night.) I think people who have never been around it would assume the worst and yes there have been some farms that have been exposed for the horrid conditions they keep the animals in but thats just greed. Not all farmers are like that and in my first hand experiences there is a right way for it to be done. There's no moral dilemmas from me or my entire family of meat eaters. Just enjoy life and dont be a fatty, everything will be alright.

Xrystofer: 110 : That's like saying that I should rape because I like it. It is a terrible reason and we also have vegan bacon.

I am pretty sure you would have a problem if the same treatment was applied to you, therefore doing it to someone else is inconsistent.

sir420: 322 : A meat animal isn't a *someone*. It's a *something*. Anthropomorphising an animal doesn't just suddenly imbue it with human properties, no matter how much your heart bleeds for it.

Xrystofer: 886 : >A meat animal isn't a someone. It's a something. Anthropomorphising an animal doesn't just suddenly imbue it with human properties, no matter how much your heart bleeds for it.

''Meat animal'' 

An animal is not a thing, it's an individual. I am not ''Anthropomorphising'' them for simply recognising that they have sentience and individuality and should be treated as such.

You are being intellectually dishonest here.

>And equating meat eating to rape is such hyperbole, 

Stop trying to strawman me, where did I say that eating meat is equal to rape?

I am simply making a comparison and demonstrating that the same reasoning can be used to justify rape.

>I'm surprised anyone actually takes it seriously and an honors it with a direct response.

I am not surprised that someone is intellectually dishonest and he is attempting to strawman me into a position that I do not hold.

sir420: 1692 : > An animal is not a thing, it's an individual. I am not ''Anthropomorphising'' them for simply recognising that they have sentience and individuality and should be treated as such.
> You are being intellectually dishonest here.

No, I'm being factually honest. While humans are animals, humans are distinct from other animals due to our ability to communicate and record our history in written (and other media) form. As such, there's no way that I'm going to value the life of a different Terran species the same way that I do human life. I'm ok with that.

> Stop trying to strawman me, where did I say that eating meat is equal to rape?
> I am simply making a comparison and demonstrating that the same reasoning can be used to justify rape.

It's a stupid comparison that doesn't hold. The trauma cause by rape is something that the (usually human) victim will have to live with for the rest of their life. Killing an animal for food doesn't leave the animal with a memory of trauma. Because it's dead. Your comparison was stupid and holds no value.

> I am not surprised that someone is intellectually dishonest and he is attempting to strawman me into a position that I do not hold.

The only one throwing strawmen is you. You're so wrapped up on moral indignation that anyone could deign to lower themselves to consuming animals for food... GTFOH. That high horse is headed for the glue factory. And I'm ok with that.

Your heart can bleed for animals as much as you want. Won't change reality. Death will come for them, and their meat will be consumed by those who enjoy such. And there is NO negative moral consequence, though you might wish it to be so. I'm certainly ok with that.

Xrystofer: 1877 : >No, I'm being factually honest. While humans are animals, humans are distinct from other animals due to our ability to communicate.

Is it okay to treat a human being that is unable to communicate, like an animal?

Is it okay to kill humans that cannot record history in any form?

>As such, there's no way that I'm going to value the life of a different Terran species the same way that I do human life.

Is it okay to kill humans that I do not value?

Would you accept your death if someone was ''okay'' with that?

1) I kill the woman afterwords, she won't have a memory trauma then.

2) I kill the woman and rape her dead body, she will be dead.

>The only one throwing strawmen is you. You're so wrapped up on moral indignation that anyone could deign to lower themselves to consuming animals for food... GTFOH. That high horse is headed for the glue factory. And I'm ok with that.

I am trying to make a point here that you are not being logically consistent, my above argument will fully demonstrate that.

>Your heart can bleed for animals as much as you want. Won't change reality. Death will come for them, and their meat will be consumed by those who enjoy such. And there is NO negative moral consequence, though you might wish it to be so. I'm certainly ok with that.

swoopyswobble: 3128 : INTRO: I consider myself omnivorous in a broad way, and I feel part of the environmentalist movement. And I only answer this because I've been asked, I usually mind my own business.

So, why I am not vegan. You are welcome to contradict me, but in a polite and calm way please, I don't like to fight over the internet.

1 - **I don't like choices by principle**. Any of this positions can be dangerous and blind the person to changes in the world. So if tomorrow pops up that eating meat is for some reason good, I would refuse it, and it's an horrible mindset for me. I don't really like "I don't eat meat", "I don't drive car", "I don't do X" thing, too easy and narrows my mind.

2 - **Meat can be more eco-friendly than vegan**. It is a very broad topic, but I was convinced about it by vegan friends. I don't find an animal as eating 10 KCal and producing 1 KCal. Or well, it may produce 1KCal of meat, but it does other things beside that. 

Take a Chicken for example: if you just put it in a movable cage and move it (animal tractor) it will eat your weeds, eat the larvae from the dropped fruit which may harbour fruit flies, scratch the soil. You can make the chicken barn close to the house and into the greenhouse, so they'll keep it warm in the night, and you'll have the valuable poop of the chickens ready to compost and to be used on plants right away. If you offer to go clean a flour mill you can brush all the cereal residues from around the building and feed your chickens with that, and give them food scraps and so on. And you'll have eggs, bones, precious manure, skin, and so on.

Other example: insects. I have vegan friends who grew lettuce, and they had snail problems. They were making beer trap and trowing the snails away.
I don't have snail problems, I have snail product. I take them and eat them.

So, I'll keep it brief: you have a load of functions in an animal, they are able to be very efficient nutrient accumulator using what is often for us unusable (think about fishes eating mosquito's larvae or... well thousand examples). That means less impact on the environment, less than buying some beans cultivated thousands of kms away, cultivated in some way that destroys your soil, than you have to use energy for hours to cook it and so on. 

3 **Meat production can be used for land restoration**. Allan Savory, Salatin and others aren't wrong: if you understand the growth dynamics of annual plants you can use animals for land restoration. Plenty of researches and papers out there.

4 : **I don't have moral thingy thing**. I don't care animals are cute or this kind of things, I care about the environment and that we all prosper and live well. This long-term goal may seem to conflict with an immediate "cruel act", I don't mind.

So, I am not a vegan, by principle. Some may ask "well, but how often do you find meat produced like that, in such a low ecological footprint?". Very rarely. That's why by seeing my diet I may seem vegan. But for heaven's sake, I'm not vegan, I like to think I just have a critical diet, and I would like to have some animals to eat for myself one day. 

Shunted23: 70 : Do you have 'moral thingy thing' when it comes to humans? If yes, why?

swoopyswobble: 523 : What do you mean? I would not eat humans, it's too unhygenic, and usually you have some strong laws making it very difficult.

I have a more complex set of ethics for humans, if that is what you mean. I try not to lie to humans, not to scam them, and such. But I don't value our life over the environment, and I think that we have a way higher responsability towards the whole planet life, since we are very intelligent and also primary cause of current ecological disaster.

Hope that is the answer you were looking for :)

Shunted23: 204 : Well when you say 'don't have moral thingy thing' does that mean you don't empathise with animals or their suffering at all? That's more what I was getting at. They are a part of the environment after all

swoopyswobble: 820 : I will answer strictly to your question: no, by saying that I don't have a moral thingy thing means that I don't exclude actions by principle and that I think I should do the best thing I can, trying to harm as little as possible other living beings. That is not necessarily involving empathy, more often an eyeball on where is the most damage. I try to keep cold on my choices to make the most out of them, empathy is too connected to what you can relate to, to what you can see and it's closer to you.

On the personal side, as it is a personal question, yes, I feel the pain of other living beings to a certain degree, especially plants and animals, and I feel the shame for not being able so far to boost life around me more than I kill it.

I hope I understood your question now, if not be patient, I can be slow :)

Shunted23: 231 : Yeah no I think we're on the same page now :) 

From your original post, I gather that you try to steer clear of mass produced animal products for the sake of the environment. Could I ask what animal products you consume regularly?

swoopyswobble: 1191 : > Could I ask what animal products you consume regularly?

Practically none, unfortunately. I sometimes do volunteering and collaboration with projects and permaculture farms and when they happen to have animals I enjoy eating eggs, little bit of milk (I can't digest it properly so it's really a taste) or even the meat if they have some, but it's quite rare. I have a neighbour who has some chickens, so an egg sometimes happens, but I know that he buys the feed for them so I don't do that often.

To sum up, I don't consume any animal product regularly, sometimes I find good and properly done stuff and in those case I eat it, I judge it from case to case. 
The same goes for vegetables of course, I don't eat soy usually, I don't buy exotic fruits, especially since I worked in farms in the tropics and I know how sick the production can be, especially of bananas, and such.

It's a tough life, if you ask me. The food production and the economy around it is so rotten that it makes very difficult and expensive to make different choices. Even the so called organically grown stuff is often just slightly less worst. 

I'll stop the rant here, I could go on for a while. Are you vegan?

Shunted23: 561 : Yes. I went vegan a couple of years ago and only regret not doing it sooner. Animal welfare was my primary driving force so I spend a good bit of time in this subreddit trying to convince people that eating animal products is morally wrong. You seem to be doing a lot better than the average person in that regard and I'd admit that the relative impact of eating eggs from backyard hens is rather small. Is your willingness to eat meat grounded in the belief that animals are less worthy of moral consideration than humans? Hope you don't mind all the questions

swoopyswobble: 1867 : I don't consider other animals less worthy, I don't have any such scale in my mind. The point is this: we living beings need to eat. How can I do so and at the same time do as little harm as possible, or even be positive in my effects?

Now, I don't want to make this too long, but animals can play important role in ecosystem design, make useful works and at the same time providing with food. This is more sustainable than eating only vegetables, especially since in the most efficient designs you are mimicking a natural system, which includes animals and without them you have to input your own work (sometimes with machinery and such). I said much about it in my previous post about chickens, but I could say more about pigs and goats too, for example. 

Beside that, in this kind of systems they usually live an happy life. That is not because of moral ground, but because if you use all their potential you are making them do what they want to. If a pig likes to roll in mud and compact the soil you let him and use it to stabilize the base of a pond. If a chicken likes to poop around you don't see it as an annoying byproduct, you use it as compost. If they eat nice and live nice you get better food and they don't fight and don't get sick and so on, you get the idea, tons of benefits on treating them well, beside the joy that an happy pig can bring to your life!

On a side note, I am willing to eat meat because I like it and find it nutricious, and I always fail to see it as a moral problem. I love to see my pumpkins grow and I love to eat them.

I see a problem when you are damaging other living beings in the process, that I why I don't usually eat meat or animal derivatives, but I don't think this mass production and violence and subsidy from the state to conventional farmers are the only way we have.

I hope you don't mind all the answers :)

Shunted23: 258 : Not at all.

There is still a bone of contention here though. The act of killing the animals for food causes harm. Even if it's done swiftly and with as little pain as possible, they are still killed prematurely and miss out on years of their natural lives. 

sydbobyd: 136 : > I don't care animals are cute or this kind of things

Well that's not really relevant to the moral argument for veganism, to be fair. 

SpaceWolf35: 111 : Not logically but let’s be honest, most vegans were spurred by the idea of cutesy animals being hurt or killed.

sydbobyd: 96 : I can't say what spurred most vegans, which I find also pretty irrelevant to the moral argument.

SpaceWolf35: 48 : Most vegans are women, women are very emotional.

SpaceWolf35: 39 : Great discussions on plebbit, as usual.

swoopyswobble: 486 : well, I was putting it in light words, what I meant is that cruelty against animals in itself isn't the point. I mean, killing and eating an animal may seem cruel by many standards. The point is life in general. 

The systems that make the most cruelty against animals (mass productions of meat and eggs and such) are also environmental bombs, and that is why I don't support them with my diet choices. I hope that makes things clearer, I am sorry if I didn't explain myself sell enough

“I also greatly value food as a part of culture...” You probably couldn’t give half a fuck about culture. Enjoying pizza, Chinese takeout, etc, doesn’t make you cultured. Even so, you can still enjoy cultural foods that incorporate vegan alternatives.

howlin: 469 : > I honestly think too many people inappropriately project human emotions onto animals. 

Are you sure it's not the other way around?  The emotion-generating parts of the human brain are not that different compared to other mammals.  Also keep in mind that there is a strong Judeo-Christian cultural meme that humans have "souls" and animals don't, and thus they are not equivalent. Ancient cultural influences such as this can influence your thinking in subtle ways.



Cobraess: 654 : It is clear many animals don’t share a *humans* capacity for emotion (obviously, as we are the smartest creatures we know to exist), but that doesn’t mean they don’t feel at all. We aren’t saying that because they emotions that they should be alive, we are saying that they and us have the same instinct of fear, and survival which we all share. They have the capacity of pain and this should be enough. 

Also, I definitely recommend spending more time around a larger variety of animals, as I work on a farm with many exotics, and they sure as shit feel something, but it may not be something that we can understand nor equate to our complex emotions.

There are also cultures around the world that previously included cannibalism. Why shouldn’t human flesh be an acceptable cultural dish?

I retract the assumption I made about your life, but appreciation of culture is not a justified reason for contributing to the needless suffering and death of animals.

I_am_legend-ary: 39 : I’m 100% in agreement with you on this 

BruceIsLoose: 157 : What does the word "humane" mean to you? 

The definition that I find is:

* humane
hjʊˈmeɪn/Submit
adjective
1.
having or showing compassion or benevolence.

None: 9 : [deleted]

BruceIsLoose: 260 : Oh of course there are humane and inhumane ways to treat and care for living beings. Agree 100% on that point. I'm glad you agree with that definition. It brings me to the next point of:

How is *slaughtering* a living being showing compassion or benevolence? 

I_am_legend-ary: 50 : You can compassionately kill somebody / something 

lumosnox77: 41 : Could somebody compassionately kill you? 

I_am_legend-ary: 142 : Compassion isn’t binary 

Somebody could certainly kill me with some compassion, a shot the the brain rather than slowly starving me to death 

lumosnox77: 137 : Only relative to starving, someone coming up to you and shooting you is not showing you compassion if they are doing you unnecessary harm

I_am_legend-ary: 497 : But I don’t value the life of an animal as highly as I value the life of a human.

In addition you are talking about a pointless killing, killing a chicken isn’t pointless we are going to eat it. 

Say me and 4 other people were deserted on a island with nothing to eat, would I be ok with us agreeing to kill and eat one of the people to keep going, yes. But in the same way I want my chicken to be killed as humanly as possible I want the same for one of these people (especially if it was me)  

lumosnox77: 287 : Nor do I, obviously killing a cow is not as bad as killing a human.

If you were killing a human to use their skin in your upholstery that is a purpose, but it does not make it ethical.

You are not forced to eat chicken for survival like you are forced to eat human meat on the island. 

I_am_legend-ary: 137 : But that chicken is only their as a source of food, if we didn’t breed it for meat it likley would have never existed in the first place 

lumosnox77: 161 : This does not justify unethical practices today. If you were bred into indentured servitude it would not be ethical just because you were born for that purpose. 

I_am_legend-ary: 214 : No, but I’m not a chicken I have yet to see any evidence that a chicken is capable of this level of self awareness.

In addition what if your coop was so large that the chicken was not aware they were being farmed 

lumosnox77: 224 : It doesn't matter how well you treat an animal or how self aware it is if you're going to kill it in its prime then that's unethical.

I'll leave aside that the vast majority of chickens are raised in appalling  conditions. 

BruceIsLoose: 28 : Can you name some examples? 

Merkmerkm: 185 : I don't agree with slaughter animals for food is humane but there is definitely 'humane killing'.
Old and/or very sick people that want to die, killing them would be out of compassion. 

BruceIsLoose: 188 : > Old and/or very sick people that want to die, killing them would be out of compassion. 

I agree! That is a good example. 

As you’ve said, what is done to animals for food isn’t humane.

I_am_legend-ary: 142 : Compassion isn’t binary 

Somebody could certainly kill me with some compassion, a shot the the brain rather than slowly starving me to death 

BruceIsLoose: 339 : > Compassion isn’t binary

I never said it was. 

> Somebody could certainly kill me with some compassion, a shot the the brain rather than slowly starving me to death

Shooting someone and starving someone are not compassionate actions. Is one "worse" than the other? Sure. That doesn't mean that the not worse one is then compassionate. 

I_am_legend-ary: 124 : That’s exactly where I am saying that you can use our best endeavours to kill these animals as compassionately as possible. 

BruceIsLoose: 89 : I think you missed the part of my comment where I said neither of them are compassionate.

I_am_legend-ary: 88 : Compassion is a scale in my option, one is clearly more compassionate than the other. 



BruceIsLoose: 286 : A individual non-compassionate act (shooting someone in the brain and starving someone) does not then become a more compassionate act just because it is compared to a more heinous non-compassionate act.

I mean how are you even defining *compassionate* I guess is where we're stuck at. 

Cobraess: 172 : You would have to kill out of pity when no other options are available due to injury or ill health. Slaughterhouses never kill out of pity but instead due to a lack of it. 

None: 9 : [deleted]

BruceIsLoose: 491 : > I don't think it is

Earlier you did though when you said:

 >  **I think there is a humane (and inhumane) way** to treat animals leading up to **and in doing the actual slaughtering.**

---

> but it is necessary for humans to eat other living beings to survive whether it's plant, animal or both.

I'd agree. We need to eat other living things to get the nutrients we need to survive. 

Do you think plants and animals (which includes us) are on the same moral/ethic "level" so to speak?

None: 9 : [deleted]

BruceIsLoose: 1111 : > so I wanted to express that in undertaking this necessary 'evil' I do believe that we should strive to be humane.

So if we're trying to be more humane (showing compassion and benevolence) isn't the best thing to do is eliminate the types of living beings that feel pain, form social bonds, solve puzzles, show various signs of consciousness, are emotive, understand the world around them in various capacities, and countless other markers (that we as humans also do just at a greater level) from our plates as much as possible? 

Is it more compassionate and benevolent to eat pieces of primarily baby animals or plants? Which is the lesser of these "necessary evils" in your opinion? 


> is that I see animals as very close to plants where a vegan would likely see them as much closer to humans.

If you were to make a chart of the characteristics that plants, animals, and humans have you think there is more overlap between *plants and animals* rather than *animals and humans (a.k.a- a species of animals)*? 

Being vegan or not has no bearing on the fact that what you're stating is objectively false. 

None: 9 : [deleted]

BruceIsLoose: 1540 : > I can't reply to every point you made 

I only made two ;)

I would like if you tried to address the last one I made though. 

> Based on what you are saying, would you agree that there are varying degrees of wrongness when eating different animals? Is eating a fish less wrong than eating a dog because it displays less of the shared characteristics with humans?

It is a good question. Overall, I would have to disagree for two reasons. The first being that I don't think there could be a varying degree of wrongness between eating those two things *because one displays less of the shared characteristics with humans*. I don't base things on how close or far away they are from human characteristics; that is a selfish way to view things. Secondly, I'm iffy on the "less wrong" part. Would it be "less wrong" for someone to chop off my arm before they kill me rather than all four limbs before killing me? Is one less severe than the other? Sure. Is one "less wrong"? I don't really think so.

Eating and a fish and eating a dog are both equally wrong in my eyes because they're sentient beings who don't want to die, interact with the world around them, and countless other characteristics so eating them when I have the choice not to is selfish. Sure we can split hairs on the differences between the two species, and yes if I had a gun to my head and had to choose I would kill the fish over the dog, but in the end it is wrong to kill a sentient being for temporary taste buds satisfaction when I can choose a plant-based option.



fatdog1111: 2031 : I know you asked BruceIsLoose and not me, but there's a tremendous amount of science about emotion and cognition in animals that puts them far closer to the human side of things than the plant. Just look at how our brains evolved and the overlap with other mammals, some of whom we harm and kill just for our own culinary pleasure. The "human" part of the brain is the prefrontal cortex, and that's not the one that'd be primarily impacted if we were stuffed in a gestation crate like sows or packed into tiny cages like laying hens. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_in_animals

I like great English philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham's quote: "The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?" 

He argues that the capacity for suffering is the essential characteristic entitling an animal to moral consideration. I grew up on a farm and saw tremendous suffering, and I agree with him. Scientists and most who've been around animals are in unison that animals do suffer. There's also a lot of [evidence that slaughterhouse workers suffer from those jobs psychologically](http://www.ptsdjournal.com/posts/the-psychological-damage-of-slaughterhouse-work/). I'm vegan precisely because I don't want to contribute to any unnecessary suffering in this world. When it comes down to eating bivalves or insects, scientists do debate whether those can suffer, so I would argue it's less wrong (or perhaps not wrong at all) to consume those. 

I'm not sure how anyone can argue for more suffering in the world rather than less, unless they lack empathy. There will never be suffering-free farms or slaughterhouses (for human workers or animals alike), and animal products are [unnecessary for most of us](http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/practice/position-and-practice-papers/position-papers/vegetarian-diets), at least if you believe the largest body of nutrition professionals in the world.

I appreciate the respectful debate you two are having. Thanks for tolerating my chiming in.  

WikiTextBot: 972 : **Emotion in animals**

Charles Darwin was one of the first scientists to write about the existence and nature of emotions in animals. His observational (and sometimes anecdotal) approach has developed into a more robust, hypothesis-driven, scientific approach. General hypotheses relating to correlates between humans and animals also support the claim that animals may feel emotions and that human emotions evolved from the same mechanisms. Several tests, such as cognitive bias tests and learned helplessness models, have been developed.

Kramerica_ind99: 588 : Vegan debates often come down to this point about humane slaughter. Honestly if we lived in a world where animals were raised on happy farms, and slaughtered if a way where they didn't know it was coming at all and didn't feel a thing, I probably wouldn't have become vegan. Also, in order for that to be a realistic scenario, all meat would be 95% more rare and expensive and people would virtually be vegan already. My point is, arguing about if it's ok to eat meat that was raised and slaughtered ethically is moot because 95% of our meat and dairy comes from factory farm hell holes. 

tiensss: 134 : Then maybe you should know that about 7x more plants die for a meat including diet than for a vegan one. Does this change your answer?

MnemonicFitness: 121 : Because going vegan would require me to considerably reduce my life quality - a sacrifice I'm just not prepared to make. 

Shunted23: 64 : Which part of going vegan would cause this reduction in quality?

MnemonicFitness: 924 : The part, where we give moral consideration to the welfare and lives of animals. I think this as severe implications to our lives in modern society, such as who we make our transactions with, the concept of pet ownership, medicine etc. I can't see how a vegan can consistently function in a society of meat eaters - while he may not consume animal products himself, by virtue of living in a modern society he's still helping other meat eaters contribute and support the meat industry. 

I understand that veganism is limited by what is possible and practicable, but I feel that this is nothing more than a cop-out - a cheap excuse that saves you from the guilt of putting your own personal convenience over the lives and welfare of animals. I can't function in a state of perpetual cognitive dissonance, and since I don't have the willpower and strength of character to go all the way with veganism, I remain a non-vegan. 



Shunted23: 771 : > while he may not consume animal products himself, by virtue of living in a modern society he's still helping other meat eaters contribute and support the meat industry.

I think it's important to think practically about this. Change is happening and it will start to happen faster and faster once a significant portion of the population turns vegan. Indirectly funding the animal industry in that way is a necessary evil and isn't logically inconsistent as the alternative would be conflict in which humans would get hurt. 

> a cheap excuse that saves you from the guilt of putting your own personal convenience over the lives and welfare of animals

I think it's a cop-out to get hung up on this concept and you already are living in perpetual cognitive dissonance

swimviking: 1023 : Because starches give me instant heartburn, grains make me take embarrassing emergency trips to the bathroom and give me a strange brain fog, beans make me shit the bed, and fruit makes me bleed out of my ass.  I am not exaggerating. Took me years to figure it all out but I am sure glad I did. 

Very few plant based foods sit well with me. While my cholesterol has gone up since switching to an almost entirely animal-based diet, I feel better than ever and ALL other risk factors for heart disease have improved. (My triglyceride to HDL ratio is even below 1!!). Recent research makes it pretty clear that high LDL is not as much of a factor in CVD as we have been told.  

Trust me if I thought plants were good for me I would be fine with eating them, but honestly I am also a little scared of all of the research about vegetarianism and the elderly. After reading so much over the last six years to make sure I wasn’t going to end up dead from zero-carb it seems that vegetarianism just isn’t a healthy way to live. 


Xrystofer: 1333 : Those studies are flawed by design and cannot find the link between dietary cholesterol and heart disease for a few reasons. Either the population is already sick and added dietery cholesterol has little to no effect on total serum cholesterol or it's a cross-sectional design study.

''Cross-sectional designs are therefore not suitable for studying this relationship.''
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/313701


African Americans in ARIC who had mutations in PCSK9 had 28% less LDL cholesterol and an 88% lower risk of developing heart disease than people without the mutations. White people with the less severe mutation in the gene had a 15% reduction in LDL and a 47% reduced risk of heart disease.
https://www.nature.com/news/genetics-a-gene-of-rare-effect-1.12773

In this study, those who followed a plant based diet, only 1 out of 178 had another cardiac arrest episode (0.6%), in contrast to those who were not adhere to had a percentage of 62% of having another cardiac arrest episode.
http://dresselstyn.com/JFP_06307_Article1.pdf


>Very few plant based foods sit well with me. 

I heard of people saying that had a lot of allergies and digestive problems went away. Wouldn't you be willing to give it a try and slowly incorporate those foods into your diet? Perhaps consult an expert and research your own condition.

swimviking: 3966 : on the first link I agree that modern science has issues with what kind of studies they use to evaluate all sorts of stuff. I would go one further and say that the corporate influence on our nutrition science is insane.

on the second link i guess i am not sure why you bring up mutations. That is like bringing up hypercholesterolemia to prove a point and that is a different beast entirely.  I am a “lean mass cholesterol hyper-responder” and while my cholesterol is high that is nothing like having FH. 

on the third link, it is about having “another” cardiac episode. In all of the research, this is also the only situation where statins seems to have any positive effect (not that it helps that you still would have to live with the other horrible side effects of the drug that are rooted in the lowering of cholesterol.) I guess this doesn’t impress me because it seems that the reason they would improve has nothing to do with the absence of meat. If I just had the shit scared out of me with a cardiac event, I would probably also be cutting out soda, sweets, fried (and fried/breaded) foods and all the other stuff that even the village idiot knows is unhealthy as well. Just like any other study showing the positives of vegetarianism, it is most likely comparing to the standard american diet, which couldn’t win a swimming race against a chicken. 

as far as adding foods and testing my food reactions, I haven’t consulted an expert but over six years I have experimented quite a bit. My wife still thinks red meat is unhealthy and that potatoes are essential. she has mellowed some but and is definitely eating lower carb as she has watched me thrive, but still has forced me to try things often. (I had an incident with a peach that really frightened me.) I had lived with stomach pain and bathroom emergencies all my life and wondered how everyone else dealt with it, thinking it must be normal. My father and sister also had these issues. Also the absolute brain fog and low energy I thought was normal was debilitating. Changing to a carnivorous diet is allowing me to be a better father to my children. 

I had a discussion once with my doctor about trying to find a drug that could help me eat “normally” again but she finally said “why?  The proof is in the pudding. This is obviously working for you so why do you care if you can’t eat a potato? Recent research is agreeing with everything you are reading about cholesterol, heart disease, cancer and all that so I say just count your blessings and save your money. For all we know you might be the only person around who is eating normally.”

Sadly, my wife eats a near vegetarian diet, allowing some meat but avoiding saturated animal fats. Her cholesterol is incredibly low and she has always been proud of it. She gets sick every time our kids do while i hardly ever do. She is much more moody and is exhausted at the end of her work day (while she works seven hours and i work fifteen per day,) she is much more moody (although that might have nothing to do with diet,) and she is currently waiting on tests because she may be getting diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Since this is a possibility I have started researching and found that low cholesterol is often a precursor for RA, and that there are implications that carbohydrate is the culprit. (other research links wheat gluten as well.) Also, the rates for vegetarians and arthritis are higher.  Relief for RA is one of the things often talked about in zero carb forums. If my wife is diagnosed with RA, we might be doing the same food elimination experiments with her, and i will plead with her to seek foods that have saturated animal fats. I am terrified for my wife but if she suggests going vegan to fight RA I will absolutely fight her on it. I feel that she has done herself a great disservice by following the low fat dogma and I believe that agenda was pushed by vegetarians in the corporate world and in our politics. 

Xrystofer: 255 : low fat dogma? Our main source of energy is carbohydrates and we simply need a little bit of protein and fats for other function. Our brain and muscles need glucose. On a low carb diet you are causing yourself to go into ketosis, that is not a good thing.

swimviking: 124 : you don't even pass nutrition 101 with this comment.  I eat virtually zero carbohydrates.  approximately 70% fat.  thriving.

Xrystofer: 133 : This is anecdotal evidence, it doesn't constitute a real argument.

This is real science. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzHLAqyO7PQ

swimviking: 772 : ketogenic diets for medical treatment of epilepsy are often super low protein and tested many types of fats without avoiding hydrogen used vegetable oils and other transfats that we now know are unhealthy when we didn’t back then,  usually avoiding the saturated animal fats which are the most stable and healthiest,  and take data from sick children often confined to beds, etc... many other studies referencing negative effects with keto are mouse studies. in those they often feed them a high fat chow made with absurd concoctions that don’t represent real keto eating. (not to mention that mice are herbivores and we are not...) Trust me I did a lot of research on keto when i first tried it because, remember, back then I still assumed animal foods weren’t healthy.

Results: The most common early-onset complication was dehydration, especially in patients who started the KD with initial fasting. Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, such as nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation, also were frequently noted, sometimes associated with gastritis and fat intolerance. Other early-onset complications, in order of frequency, were hypertriglyceridemia, transient hyperuricemia, hypercholesterolemia, various infectious diseases, symptomatic hypoglycemia, hypoproteinemia, hypomagnesemia, repetitive hyponatremia, low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein, lipoid pneumonia due to aspiration, hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, and persistent metabolic acidosis. Late-onset complications also included osteopenia, renal stones, cardiomyopathy, secondary hypocarnitinemia, and iron-deficiency anemia. Most early- and late-onset complications were transient and successfully managed by careful follow-up and conservative strategies. However, 22 (17.1%) patients ceased the KD because of various kinds of serious complications, and four (3.1%) patients died during the KD, two of sepsis, one of cardiomyopathy, and one of lipoid pneumonia.

swimviking: 1506 : I got really curious about the claim that atherosclerosis affects only herbivores from your paper above.

(I see this all the time in human testimonials, but until there are about 10,000 studies comparing veganism to carnivory no one will believe it and very few will even discuss it.)  

So I looked it up.  Apparently atherosclerosis is common in household cats and dogs.

so what is different about household pets that are carnivorous and carnivores in the wild?  The food they eat.  People buy grain, corn and other crap-based food, sprinkle a little meat flavoring in it, and tell people that it is healthy for their pets.  Our digestive system is pretty similar to that of cats and dogs.  I would be willing to bet that just like them, people would not develop atherosclerosis if they avoid that stuff too.  Couldn't that be possible?

Trying to make our dogs and cats herbivores is cruel.

>Either way, this makes the case that in this context, what makes an animal an herbivore or a carnivore is not their nature or scientific classification. It is the food they choose to eat.

You are confusing obligated and facultative omnivores. Humans are facultative omnivores, but our true classification is that of a frugivore.

Pet foods are usually meats that are not fit for human consumption, this is whole different topic though.

>Our digestive system is pretty similar to that of cats and dogs.

This is simply an assertion, you haven't provided any evidence. Fact is we have no instincts and no weapons to hunt. What is left to defend your position is to argue that our internal physiology is that of an omnivore.

This is simply an assertion, please present evidence for your claims. Even if you were an omnivore, you could easily survive and thrive on a plant based diet since an omnivore is capable of consuming and surviving on both plant and meat diets.

Present your evidence, I have the biggest academy of nutritionists backing me up with a huge amount of research. What do you have?

swimviking: 2009 : obviously all of the cats and dogs at the vet who have atherosclerosis did not have their thyroid removed. that is silly. you are citing the same paper that gave the ridiculous fact in the first place. 

classification aside, my point is that no matter what you classify as, if you eat like an herbivore you get herbivore diseases. hence, dogs and cats getting atherosclerosis. when i shop for food for my pets, i can buy the grain and no-grain version. still mostly corn or rice or some shit that allows it to sit on the shelves in the store for a lot longer than meat. herbivore shit that makes my animals fat and sick. just like it does people. when cats eat all meat those diseases go away. same with people. but of course no studies have been done about that. because people who eat plants only are moral and healthy but people who eat meat only must be crazy. 

my assertion from the barry groves video and several photos i have linked to is that our physiology is much more like that of any carnivorous animal. not that you would actually pay attention to the links. the idea that we have no instincts or natural weapons to hunt is ridiculous. part of the reason we evolved our large brains was not just meat-eating, but brain eating. our ability to hunt in a group and hands that allow us to break open the skull of larger animals with a rock gave us access to brain matter and fats  that are long-chained and can’t be created by our bodies. we had to eat them. 

LDL below 70 is unhealthy for all sorts of other reasons. we have been discussing arthritis, among other issues,  in other comments. 

please read the rest of the comments on this post.

Xrystofer: 4528 : >obviously all of the cats and dogs at the vet who have atherosclerosis did not have their thyroid removed. that is silly. you are citing the same paper that gave the ridiculous fact in the first place.

Read again, ''for some reason, saturated fat and cholesterol have the same effect as in herbivores.''

Omnivores/Carnivores do not get atherosclerosis from saturated fats and cholesterol, on the other hand, herbivores and humans get atherosclerosis from saturated fat and cholesterol. 

>classification aside, my point is that no matter what you classify as, if you eat like an herbivore you get herbivore diseases. hence, dogs and cats getting atherosclerosis. when i shop for food for my pets, i can buy the grain and no-grain version. still mostly corn or rice or some shit that allows it to sit on the shelves in the store for a lot longer than meat. herbivore shit that makes my animals fat and sick. just like it does people.

Vegans are the only group in the normal BMI range on average, everyone else is overweight.

>but of course no studies have been done about that. because people who eat plants only are moral and healthy but people who eat meat only must be crazy.

Humans are not able to metabolise cholesterol and Vitamin A effectively, nor can they produce their own Vitamin C. A diet in meat is not suitable for the human physiology.

>my assertion from the barry groves video and several photos i have linked to is that our physiology is much more like that of any carnivorous animal. not that you would actually pay attention to the links. the idea that we have no instincts or natural weapons to hunt is ridiculous. part of the reason we evolved our large brains was not just meat-eating, but brain eating.

There's research done of fossilized feces, here is a quote. 

''The role of dietary fiber in the preagricultural subsistence economy of early human populations strongly suggests that for over 99% of man's existence as a distinct species, his gastrointestinal track has been exposed to the selective pressures exerted by a coarse, high residue diet of plant tissues.''

https://nutritionfacts.org/video/paleopoo-what-we-can-learn-from-fossilized-feces/

In the same video it also says that in rural Africa and rural China, our modern disease are practically unknown, they eat a huge amount of dietary plant fiber.

>our ability to hunt in a group and hands that allow us to break open the skull of larger animals with a rock gave us access to brain matter and fats that are long-chained and can’t be created by our bodies. we had to eat them.

This article suggests that insects may have played a role in developing our brains. Why don't you eat insects?
https://source.wustl.edu/2014/06/insect-diet-helped-early-humans-build-bigger-brains-study-suggests/

Cooking played the a major role in our development, it allowed us to easily absorb calories from food, rather than expending energy in order to get them.

swimviking: 6117 : > "Omnivores/Carnivores do not get atherosclerosis from saturated fats and cholesterol, on the other hand, herbivores and humans get atherosclerosis from saturated fat and cholesterol."


but what I am saying is that without plant matter, especially carbohydrate in particular, this does not happen in humans.  Carnivores get our chronic diseases when they eat food similar to ours, like the packaged shit at the pet store.  If we eat their natural food, meat, we do not develop these diseases, no matter the fat or cholesterol content.  I know that you won't believe it without kellogg's or Merck funding a study on carnivory, but those studies don't happen without funding from someone trying to sell a drug that carnivory would most likely cure... which means there is no motive to find the truth.  only a path to profit.  Check out the Nequalsmany study going on now...  the only way for carnivory to be studied is if it is crowdsourced because no one in the crazy capitalist nutrition and medical industries wants us to know.

BMI:  almost every athlete I know is considered overweight in BMI.  BMI is stupid, unless you are vegan and are malnourished-- then you may fit the normal prescribed by the big brains who came up with it.

"Humans are not able to metabolise cholesterol, Vitamin A, nor can they produce their own Vitamin C. A diet in meat is not suitable for the human physiology."

says who?... I am certain that none of the 420 people in the Nequalsmany carnivory study have developed scurvy.  dumb, dumb, dumb... and are you saying that my six years with virtually no plant matter aren't possible?  you are grasping at straws.  do you eat straw?

yes, I am not against eating bugs.  actually pretty common in some parts of the world and considered a delicacy occasionally.  I actually think we should take advantage of bugs, because I am not sure vegans would have a problem with eating those...  lots of bugs are killed in agriculture.  I wish I could crush bugs and make a crust so that I can make some "pretend to eat plants" substitution meals and desserts like the vegans do with the burgers made of beans and soy and all that.  

I have no problem with the idea that cooking was a great advancement.  It allowed us to start eating things like pork and chicken.  Beef is too dense for parasites and can actually be eaten raw.  (yes I do that too.)  There is a great two page photo in a recent national geographic of an arctic tribe circled around a freshly killed reindeer and eating it raw.  See, there is such a vegan influence in our politics that I would probably be arrested if I killed a reindeer and ate it raw by the side of the road.  I sometimes think about doing that, because my natural instincts make me want to tackle and eat every animal I see.  just kidding.  kind of.

fiber is it's own bullshit science.  Please read Fiber Menace.  The history of the claims of fiber being healthy are absolutely absurd and based on a guy and his fecal fetish about a hundred years ago.  When I google search fiber and diverticulitis, it comes up with similar results to statins and RA...  science says they go badly together, but the articles still say it is all good and fiber and statins really help.  "Don't forget to buy your fiber and statins, because even though diverticulitis is caused by indigestible roughage constantly irritating the intestines, if you thought that you might stop eating fiber and see improvement without drugs!  We can't have that!"

I have heard the claim about plants and RA.  I don't buy it.  I have posted a couple of links in the comments already about RA and the evidence that it has a lot to to with carbohydrate, and may even be specifically tied to wheat.  Also, there are a lot of people on the carnivory and keto testimonials who see great relief form arthritis.  My wife has always avoided saturated animal fats and has been very proud of her low cholesterol.  I think that caused her recent possible RA diagnosis.  If you look through the links I have already posted you will see why. You will also see that if she does have RA, she is actually at MORE risk for heart disease unless she gets her cholesterol up!  Even better, those who respond well to treatment in RA also are the ones who happen to see a rise in cholesterol.  So obviously, the medical advice is to give them fucking statins, because hey if we don't keep their cholesterol down they might feel better and stop buying statins!"  Can you see why I struggle with the cholesterol denying of vegans?  cholesterol is important to immunity and to the health and protection of cells.  To obsess about getting your cholesterol down is a dangerous goal.

Xrystofer: 8134 : >BMI: almost every athlete I know is considered overweight in BMI. BMI is stupid,

BMI is for the average person to calculate their fat percentage, not for athletes. You would need to calculate their Fat, weight and height to get accurate result.

A plant based diet is appropriate for all stages of life, do not propagate myths.

It's simply facts, we suffer from hypercholesterolemia, hypervitaminosis A and Scurvy.

>I am certain that none of the 420 people in the Nequalsmany carnivory study have developed scurvy. dumb, dumb, dumb...

Does that mean that they had healthy vitamin C levels? By the way I am simply demonstrating facts about omnivores, they are capable of producing their own vitamin C and do not suffer from scurvy.

>and are you saying that my six years with virtually no plant matter aren't possible? you are grasping at straws. do you eat straw?

>>Warning, Anecdotal evidence<< 

Nope, I didn't say that. You probably are deficient in vitamin C though.

>yes, I am not against eating bugs. actually pretty common in some parts of the world and considered a delicacy occasionally.

Would you eat them roasted?

>I actually think we should take advantage of bugs, because I am not sure vegans would have a problem with eating those... lots of bugs are killed in agriculture.

Even more bugs are killed to produce animal products, since they require even more food to be produced.

>I wish I could crush bugs and make a crust so that I can make some pretend to eat plants substitution meals and desserts like the vegans do with the burgers made of beans and all that.

Do you mean burgers made from extracted protein or simply veggie burgers?

We ate mostly plant based, based on evidence found in fossilized feces.

The Okinawa Diet: Living to 100


https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/

Of the 198 patients with CVD,
177 (89%) were adherent. Major cardiac
events judged to be recurrent disease totaled
one stroke in the adherent cardiovascular
participants—a recurrent event rate of .6%,
signifcantly less than reported by other studies
of plant-based nutrition therapy. Thirteen
of 21 (62%) nonadherent participants experienced
adverse events.


http://dresselstyn.com/JFP_06307_Article1.pdf

One of the most important lessons PCSK9 has taught us comes from the work of Hobbs and colleagues (12) on loss-of-function mutations in humans. They show that the low LDL in these cohorts confers a surprising degree of protection against CVD, disproportionate to what one would have predicted based on data from the 5-year statin trials. Two nonsense mutations, relatively more common among African-Americans, were associated with plasma LDL cholesterol levels ≈28% lower than that in African-American subjects with the wild-type allele. In a 5-year statin trial in adults, that 28% reduction in LDL would be predicted to be accompanied by a 25–35% reduction in CVD risk. However, the observed reduction in CVD risk in the subjects with the PCSK9 mutations was 88%. A missense mutation, relatively more common in Caucasians, was associated with a modest 15% decrease in LDL, yet a 47% reduction in risk. Although other factors may be involved, the simplest assumption is that having the low LDL for a lifetime slowed atherogenesis much more than treatment not begun until late in life and lasting only for 5 years. This is a powerful argument for earlier intervention in treating hypercholesterolemia and reducing LDL to ideal levels.

They are a trillion dollar industry, we fund them every day with our money. People have to eat and their interest is to keep the status quo in place. They donate money to environmental and health organisations in order to keep the people misinformed.

There's plenty of studies that have been peer reviewed, I do not understand what is your problem exactly.

If you want to make a point post it here, I am only going to reply to this post.


swimviking: 1090 : I had never heard of nutrition facts but I think now they are on my short list of sites that are "like infowars but for vegans."  It is okay if you don't want to look at my links. Tons are at this post as well: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAVegan/comments/75y0xv/arent_there_ethical_arguments_for_carnivory/

I posted that for any other readers who might stumble upon this as I know you won't consider any other argument.  I am sure you think the same of me, but I came to my path in a way that started as very skeptical and have done a lot of research and self-experimentation.  Lots of people come to veganism for relief from the very diseases it causes.  Check out the links  I have posted here and on the other post for a really eye-opening world of info.  You have been lied to about food all your life.  Also please check out zerocarbzen.com

when only 1.2% of plant life is edible and 98% of life from the animal kingdom is edible, it has to be entertained as a possibility that meat is our optimal food.

Don't wait until it is too late to educate yourself beyond the marketing.

Xrystofer: 706 : What exactly am I being lied to? Our brains and body requires carbohydrates as a fuel, being in ketosis is extremely unhealthy and has a myriad of side effects. Our ancestors ate mostly a plant based diet and our absorptive membranes in our gut clearly indicate what we should be eating. Then we go into the science and I show you plenty of evidence that having high cholesterol is very bad for you, and generally vegans have much better health even if you account for the fact that they have healthier habits. The longest living population was ah here to an almost completely plant based diet, we have myriads of scientific evidence to prove that a diet in plants is vastly superior to a meat eating one. 

swimviking: 1014 : That’s just it. I thought all that stuff was true as well.  I always thought plants were healthy and meat just was something we ate because we are lazy and don’t care enough... now I have seen science that refutes all of that, but only after I had to cut out plant foods and started reading like crazy because I worried it would kill me.  I guess what I am saying is that you can find all sorts of stuff out there supporting any viewpoint. We are fed all sorts of agendas from all over the media.  I just hate to see people buying into veganism without full consideration.  Most have never looked into the other side of nutrition.  Yes I have had a big mouth lately about carnivory on reddit, but the idea had never been presented to me even once in all my life, while vegetarianism is something I see every day. I truly believe the fear mongering about cholesterol is a lie and it is to sell pharmaceuticals.  Same with the arguments about diabetes.  The science is out there. Some day they will have to admit it.

Xrystofer: 871 : You have to ignore huge evidence to support your own view. We know that cholesterol is the only risk factor that makes building plaques possible.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603726/figure/F1/

'' When serum cholesterol levels (especially the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] level) are lowered (most readily, of course, by statin drugs), atherosclerotic events fall accordingly and the lower the level, the fewer the events (“less is more”).''

There's myriads of studies that clearly show that animal products are bad, the healthiest populations on the planet ate mostly a plant based diet, the biggest academy of nutritionists agrees that vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life and that a ketogenic diet has a lot of side effects and that it created all sort of problems in children. What else is there to even discuss?

Survival with only meat would be impossible, humans do not produce their own Vitamin C and would soon succumb to scurvy. Eating liver everyday would cause Hypervitaminosis A and we are not able to metabolise efficiently, heme-iron is also very detrimental to our health. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24243555 

''Our results suggest that high intakes of heme and iron from meat may be important dietary risk factors for esophageal and stomach cancer and may partly explain associations with red meat.''
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3261306/

Humans can move their jaws horizontally, we can grind, we also have weak stomach acid when we have food present in our stomachs (check link 2). 

Truth is we are unable to kill pray with out natural weapons, because we have none. 

We also get PTSD from killing animals, it is definitely something that we aren't supposed to do in order to survive.

''These employees are hired to kill animals, such as pigs and cows, that are largely gentle creatures. Carrying out this action requires workers to disconnect from what they are doing and from the creature standing before them. This emotional dissonance can lead to consequences such as domestic violence, social withdrawal, anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse, and PTSD.''
http://www.ptsdjournal.com/posts/the-psychological-damage-of-slaughterhouse-work/

Your strongest evidence was that we have a similar stomachs to dogs and our colon and intestines are not similar to other primates. Compared to the fact of how we absorb nutrients and all the other traits, this isn't enough to build a case that humans are omnivores.


swimviking: 286 : love this: “Atherosclerosis affects only herbivores. Dogs, cats, tigers, and lions can be saturated with fat and cholesterol, and atherosclerotic plaques do not develop”

So really my carnivorous lifestyle is on the right track.  kind of like this Dr who went paleo. http://lnr.li/VfDZZ

Xrystofer: 335 : I will admit that a ketogenic diet does have benefits, however the myriads of side effects are simply not worth it. 

Enlarged hearts and Kidney stones in children? Nope, not worth it.

We have science that proves that we are not obligated omnivores, we should be eating what is natural to us and not killing ourselves with our food.

Your reason is the biggest reason I hear from people.

Anyway, I switched 6 months ago to a starch based diet and the key with this one is to eat a lot of grains, beans, rice and such, to feel full.  There is cooking to it, but it is totally satisfying to me.  If I get hungry for anything, even if I'm tempted by candy or meat, I just stuff my face a lot of rice and beans etc.  It has worked so far luckily.

o_kosmos: 4766 : Man, there's a reason I don't come to this sub much despite being vegan. People rehearse the same terrible conversations over and over to the point where I just feel like writing up a response to each objection and then just using copypastas from then on.

Let me break this down:

-/u/JihadiJames was making a comparison, not an equation. The point of the comparison was to illustrate that "I like X too much to stop doing it" is a bad line of defense when the X in question harms others.

-To make that point, he used a comparison of something that we all agree on: that "I like raping too much to stop doing it" is not a good enough reason to keep raping.

This is because we all recognize that sometimes our preferences affect others in negative ways, and it's perfectly reasonable for someone to point out that you ought not to act on your preferences in some cases. Like with rape. He could have just as easily used other comparisons to make the same point: thieves don't get to keep stealing just because they like it, dog-fighters don't get to keep dog-fighting because they like it, etc.

So meat doesn't grow out of the ground, a living, experiencing creature first has to be killed for you to be able to taste it. So this is an instance where, despite you liking something, there is a victim involved.

(Is this all a bit condescending? I honestly can't tell anymore, because people like you, /u/Wezirn  and /u/TBdog actually seem to need lengthy explanations for what comparisons are, how they work, and how they apply to the case at hand.)

Now let's look at how you guys typically respond to a comparison such as this. Remember, all /u/JihadiJames was comparing is the justification for doing an action, however pleasurable, where there's a victim involved. You three seem to think it's an adequate response to loudly declare the absurdity of comparing rape and "eating meat" (you should be comparing rape and slaughter, but whatever). /u/JihadiJames wasn't merely asserting that rape and slaughter are of equal severity or level of harm, he was saying that they are alike in certain ways and we can all tell that the "I like it tho" defense doesn't work in the case of one, so why think it applies in the case of the other? As I've now spelled out, there are numerous comparisons to be made that all illustrate this very same point.

Is this clear enough yet? Do you see what comparison he was actually making to the point where you can  mount some kind of real defense? Because at this point you should be saying something like 

>Ah, I see what you're saying. However, I think rape is unacceptable because the victim is a human, whereas with slaughter the victim is only an animal. Since I only recognize that humans have moral status, it is permissible to slaughter animals for food since their victimhood is irrelevant.

Great, now we're on our way to having an actually substantial exchange. Now we can debate whether you should recognize that animals are deserving of some ethical consideration. I could also test the sincerity of your view here by asking you whether dog-fighting, or even dog-raping, are acceptable as long as the humans involved get some pleasure out of it. But you didn't say anything so productive. Instead you guys all act as if there are no relevant comparisons to be made without explaining why, presumably just relying on the intuition that any reasonable person reading this exchange will also fall back on "HAHA! This guy thinks meat is the same as murder or rape! What a moron!"

I suggest that you actually look like the following:

>A: We should never have built San Francisco here. This place is unstable and we're constantly going to run into trouble. We're like ants who built their ant-hill on the side of the Nile River.

>B: Lol this idiot thinks San Franciscans are the same as ants! 

...

>A: We at Ford Motors believe that a company is like a car. We have lots of parts working together, and the whole system is damaged if any part isn't doing its job.

>B: Wow get a load of this guy! He thinks companies and cars are literally the same, like he can't even tell that cars aren't made of people! HAHAHA

I honestly question whether you're even trying to understand your opponent when you come strutting in ready to dismiss any and all comparisons without a moment of hesitation. I invite you to get back to the subject at hand and explain why you think it is acceptable to hurt and kill animals like pigs and cows just because you happen to enjoy the taste of their cooked bodies. I mean I enjoy the taste too, but I stopped participating in that senseless violence and exploitation because I see that as the opposite of compassion and empathy, which I value above gastronomic satisfaction. How about you?

o_kosmos: 818 : Look, you low-effort troll, it's obvious enough that /u/JihadiJames was making a comparison even in the quote you just pulled out. In case you were still unsure, you could just scroll down with your fucking mouse wheel and you'd see him say 

>I wasn’t **comparing** actions, I was **comparing** mental processes. 

Wow look at that, using the word "compare" even while explaining to you what he's comparing! It doesn't get much easier as far as reading comprehension is concerned. 

Imagine how difficult conversations would be if everyone took your lazy, selective tunnel-vision approach. Like when you said 

>haha apparently all meat eaters are rapists

I could have just come along with a hit-and-run one-liner like you, and said, "*Technically,* he didn't say *all* meat eaters are rapists, just that one guy." 


None: 9 : [deleted]

o_kosmos: 243 : People who respond exclusively by lazy, thoughtless one-liners are already bordering on troll territory. Adding to that how your one-liners consistently misrepresent and/or misunderstand your interlocutors, and that makes you a genuine troll. 

TBdog: 1641 : The person could have used a comparison analogy on many different things, such as drinking alcohol because they enjoy it, or smoking a cigar. But they purposely chose one of the my most immoral and hated crimes in human society that’s punishable with severe sentencing. If you ever deal with a sexual assaulted victim, there is a huge difference between them and an abused dog. If you observed the neighbour next door, cooking some meat on the BBQ, with the smell of marinated cooked meat flowing through the air. He breathes in deeply and says out loud ‘I love the taste of meat.’ Comical aside, if your response to that thought process out loud is comparing it to the pleasure of sexual assault, then you automatically forfeit a debate on ethics. The comparison is absurd and is even more so that the person questioned the other persons intelligence before the sexual assault punch line. It’s unnecessary, shouldn’t be mentioned, and shouldn’t even be in a realm of comparison. 


And it is not just the rape comparison which is bad, but it’s these ludicrous comparison that I have been reading on here. ‘Bees are not slaves for us. Slavery is bad. Therefore getting Bees to make honey for us is slavery.’ It is not comparative. There is a distinctive difference between owning another person as a slave and that of bees. There are many reasons why one will choose a diet over another. But choosing veganism for ethical reasons usually falls flat. Debating here is pretty much a pointless endeavour because you hear responses and comparisons like the appalling one that I just heard, and the vegans will back up the claim and defend it. 



o_kosmos: 2055 : > The person could have used a comparison analogy on many different things, such as drinking alcohol because they enjoy it, or smoking a cigar.

I see you're struggling to comprehend why he picked rape as opposed to these suggestions of yours. When a man smokes a cigar, who is the victim who is automatically forced to suffer and die so that he can do so? There isn't one, and that's why he chose something with an actual victim, namely rape. As I tried to point out in the wall of text above, one can pick other actions with ANIMAL victims so that it's easier for you to follow the analogy. Let me try that again:

Do you think it would be ethical for a man to do either of the following for the reason that he enjoys doing so? 

(a.) force a dog to fight with another dog

(b.) rape a pig

If a man's only justification for doing (a) or (b) is that he "likes it" then I still see it as unethical. What do you think? Then, assuming you agree neither one is ethically permissible, why would it be OK to kill and eat a dog or a pig? (Provided that you absolutely don't need to do so for health or survival, but rather you do so because you enjoy the way their cooked bodies taste in your mouth.)

>Debating here is pretty much a pointless endeavor because you hear responses and comparisons like the appalling one that I just heard

Have you honestly considered that your frustration is not the result of all of your opponents being legitimately ridiculous, but because either your reading comprehension sucks or you're just not being charitable towards the vegan side of the argument? That argument you just quoted about honey is terrible, you're right. But who cares, it's not the best that anyone here can come up with.

I'm rapidly losing interest in this thread because it's all about comparisons that someone else made and your inability to understand how they're relevant. There's only so much I can do. Raping humans is **not morally equivalent to killing farm animals**, but that was never the point to begin with. Fucking nobody even said that. 

TBdog: 360 : Having sex with a pig is an offence called Bestiality under my state law and it's a imprisonment sentence. Also there is a clear difference again. Those that commit the crime are a danger to society. Dog fighter is also against the law for obvious reasons and underground dog fighting causes issues. Why are you comparing an illegal act to that of a legal one?

o_kosmos: 387 : I know what's legal and what's not in the U.S. You're aware that they're not illegal in some places, yeah? Are they ethical to do in those places? Are they ethical to do in places that may have the laws but can't enforce them? Do you think whatever is legal is ethical, and whatever is ethical is legal? Do you think if we made killing pigs illegal that would make it unethical to do so?

TBdog: 1370 : Your refering to dog fighting, yeh, and not bestality?

I think dog fighting is unethical. Same as bull running and matador stuff that goes on there. I find working dogs as fine or police dogs that fight and get killed on the job as ethical sounding. I find horse riding and racing to be ethical. We set guidelines for many things like Greyhound racing has a bad history of techniques there. The list could go on and on. Morals and ethics is a highly studied field and there are some interesting readings out there. When it comes to ethics, there is a lot of grey. We tried legislate as much as we can. We set up investigation inquiries units to be the watchdogs of many different agencies. But none of these have anything to do with eating meat. So when you defend sexual assault in comparison of meat eating, regardless what you thought they were alleging, it has no justification to compare the too.

We know bestality is wrong. It's really wrong. It's dangerous for a member of society to belong while committing those acts. We know the teenager down the road that decapitates a cat once a month is far more dangerous than the teenager that lives up the road that goes to work at a factory farm and pulls the trigger of nail gun to an animal head every day of the week.

There is a clear difference, and the more you try and compare them the worse your argument is. 

passionseeker95: 328 : How is dog fighting unethical though, while slaughtering animals for taste pleasure isn't? Or say, even if they'd hypothetically kill dogs painlessly, as a sport, because it's fun. Wouldn't it still be unethical? How does eating meat for pleasure differ from that? 

Not trying to attack, just interested in a good discussion :)

TBdog: 1148 : Can you agree to the bestality response and also respond to my cat killer and factory farming anology. Debates can't go one way.

As for dog fighting. It's a blood sport. Sport resorts to gamberling. To have an effective dog fighter you need to emotional break down the dog to hate others, to isolate it, to blooden it (I made up that word but it's a technique to encourage dogs to go harder.) 

To me, and I am sure you would agree that dog fighting provides little to no benifit to society. Dogs in dog fighting is like sporting equipment. Once they are damage, they are discarded. We can have dogs aiding in law enforcement because they provide a benifit to society. Some law enforcement dogs have social issues but they are not at the same extent as dog fighters. Some dogs in law enforcement die on duty. 

Killing animals for food is different than killing animals for sport and entertainment. I understand that food sometimes crosses over into entertainment territory, but it's not its primary purpose.

So question for you. What is worse and more unethical? The person who is eating the meat paddy, or the trainer/owner of the dog fighter? 

RobertRedfort: 722 : Initially i joined this sub to gain a broader perspective on veganism and the meat industry. However i got very dissapointed in the amount of condescending comments flying around, both ways yes but especially from vegans towards carnivores.

Honestly i dont care if he was making an equation or a comparison, if you dont bother responding people respectfully you should just stay silent. Especially on topics that you have a personal relation to.

o_kosmos: 742 : >My response to the fella here about his level of intelligence was only to point out how demeaning he was replying to that other comment and how comments like his (in my opinion) is destructive for a healthy dialogue. 

Agreed about the insulting intelligence, and I said as much to him. Fuck all that. Of course, your response 

>What do you think it says about your intelligence that you judge him to be a rapist without empathy because he enjoys meat because its tasty?

Just threw the intelligence insult right back at him, all while saying that he thinks that meat eaters are rapists (or as bad as rapists? something along these lines). That's probably a bad, uncharitable way of interpreting his comparison for the reasons I went into. 

RobertRedfort: 176 : I did not insult him i asked a sincere question. I thought that in order to even begin a healthy debate with this guy i need to understand his understanding of intelligence :)

JihadiJames: 102 : Oh look. Someone else who can’t read. 

I wasn’t comparing actions, I was comparing mental processes. 

TBdog: 213 : Nope. You said 'to rape someone' ie an act. Regardless, comparing the thought process of 'meat taste good' and to the effect of 'raping someone because it feels good', is absurd and a morally bankrupt philosophy. 

sydbobyd: 351 : I did not make the comparison, but I believe what the other commenter's getting at is that using "meat tastes good" as a justification for eating meat is little different than using "sex feels good" as a justification for rape. Obviously, that does *not* justify rape, and so neither can we say "it tastes good" justifies eating meat in and of itself.

JihadiJames: 65 : Why can nobody explain to my why it’s an unjustified comparison. 

jsfly: 145 : It's a really bad comparison that encapsulates the reason why so many people hate on vegans.... because they argue to insult, not to persuade. 



o_kosmos: 522 : This one guy isn't representative of shit.

Not only that, but he's trying to make a comparison, regardless of whether it's insulting to you personally, you could at least try to explain why it's a bad comparison. But you don't do that, instead you move on to generalize about a group of people and explain why they're hated, namely because they do something bad. You're saying something about vegans that could almost be construed as...what's the word...insulting.

I'm not sure if the irony of the situation escapes you.

jsfly: 362 : I found this thread from r/facepalm where this post is on the front page. 500+ upvotes is what reddit thinks of your militant veganism.

It's a bad comparison because only those with vegan morals find it valid and they use it to circlejerk themselves into thinking they're morally superior. Meanwhile regular folks just laugh at the absurdity of crazy vegans. 



JihadiJames: 144 : But there must be something wrong when none of these “regular folks” are unable to construct a counter argument against my “militant vegansim”. 

jsfly: 543 : There are plenty of good counters. One counter for example would be to side with moral relativism over moral absolutism. Ie, my moral standards are different from yours, my morality values animal lives far less than human lives, thus your comparison is invalid because rape is immoral whereas meat eating is moral and I am able to do indulge in the former while abstaining from the latter. 

The problem is, no one likes getting into such arguments with crazy vegans so no one took your bait. They'd rather just make fun of how absurd you are.

JihadiJames: 930 : My comparison had no relation to morals, so subjective morality has nothing to with my point. My comment was regarding mental processes. Therefore your entire response is irrelevant. 

Luckily for you, I’ll respond anyway. 
If you can deem that the act of eating meat is moral, and it would therefore be incorrect to call you immoral for eating meat, likewise, a rapist could deem the act of rape as moral, and it would therefore be incorrect to call the rapist immoral for raping someone. 

See. It doesn’t add up. 

> The problem is, no one likes getting into such arguments with crazy vegans
Yeah, because eating meat is fundamentally wrong, and they have no valid arguments to support their disgusting actions. If it makes me a “crazy vegan” for opposing the needless suffering and death of animals, I’m fine with that. 

>They'd rather just make fun of how absurd you are.
Because that’s the only thing they’re able to do... 

jsfly: 479 : 1. I was trying to do you a service there by adding the needed depth to your argument from a moral perspective. Without it, your "argument" becomes nothing but a moot point. ie: You enjoy posting on reddit in the same way a rapist enjoys raping people. Look at me, I can compare mental processes too.

2. Again, incorrect. You think I'm immoral for eating meat, I think I'm moral. The rapist deems his act of rape moral, but we both think otherwise. Everything adds up just fine.

JihadiJames: 376 : > 1. I was trying to do you a service there by adding the needed depth to your argument from a moral perspective. 
No. You were trying to pull the “morality is subjective” card to justify eating meat.

JihadiJames: 590 : > I'm just stating facts bro.

Farmed animals are unprotected by most state criminal anti-cruelty laws and even omitted from the federal Animal Welfare Act. The only federal oversight of their treatment comes during transportation and slaughter.

There are no federal laws governing the conditions in which farmed animals are raised.

The majority of farmed animal suffering is exempt from state criminal anti-cruelty laws.

Many individual state criminal anti-cruelty laws exempt “standard” or “commonly accepted” agricultural practices, which are not defined by the legislature.

Oh my god you're incapable of explaining yourself. Comparisons aren't good if most people agree with them and bad if most people disagree with them, holy shit.

Here you'll learn what the comparison is, what it's not, and how you should and shouldn't go about responding to it.

> and they use it to circlejerk themselves into thinking they're morally superior

It's actually being used here to make people like yourself reflect on your own actions, and to prompt you to think about whether you have any better justification than a ~~rapist~~ [insert some comparison that won't trigger you] who does as they please despite what happens to their victims. 

I already know that veganism is morally superior to harming animals for pleasure, but that clearly doesn't mean every vegan is morally superior to every non-vegan. Of course some vegans are uncaring in other ways, or have other undesirable qualities, meanwhile plenty of non-vegans are outstandingly moral people who may or may not have given veganism any real thought. 

>Meanwhile regular folks just laugh at the absurdity of crazy vegans.

The one thing I take from this entire discussion is that some of the people, not all, on the vegan side seem to have simplistic points of view. The people on the other side are giving more detailed reasoning. 

"Killing animals makes me feel bad. Rape is bad. They are comparable." That's asinine. The world is bigger and more complex than the "how does this make ME feel" mindset.

Who said that? Or who are you paraphrasing? 

Have you even read any academics arguing for our position or do you rely on your own (poor) comprehension of random Reddit posts? Try [this guy.](http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/readings/norcross.pdf) 

>That's asinine

Yeah, the position you just pulled out of your own asshole is asinine, go figure. I refuse to believe you just read the comment that I linked in my last response to you, and you walked away thinking that my position is that we shouldn't kill animals because it makes me feel bad. 

Hurting and killing animals damages *them*, they're the victims here, not me. It does make me feel bad to know that they're being hurt but that's not my primary or only reason for trying to tell you to stop hurting and killing them. 

>"how does this make ME feel" mindset.

Sigh. The vegans are the ones trying to get you to expand your mindset beyond "how does this make ME feel?" Killing animals for pleasure is selfish, and we're saying you don't take into account how it affects the victims, the animals. That's why rape is in the fucking picture here. Because rapists also do what they like without regard for how their victims are affected. 

Stop focusing on rape if it outrages you beyond reason. THIEVES steal without regard for their victims, and we don't think "but I like my stolen goods" is a good justification for their actions. Dog-fighters like their dog-fighting but we think that's a poor justification too. Why is it different for slaughtering pigs for meat? That's the question here. That's the only thing the comparison is supposed to draw out, it's supposed to get you to make sense for the seeming inconsistency here. 

sydbobyd: 200 : > "Killing animals makes me feel bad. Rape is bad. They are comparable." That's asinine.

That isn't the comparison. I'd encourage you to read the comment linked by /u/o_kosmos above for elaboration.

Look, in my experience there are only two ways of convincing people to go vegan, or probably anything else: show that it follows from the values they already hold (easier route) or persuade them that they should adopt new values (harder route and probably going to have to appeal to other values of theirs at some point anyway).

Have you ever convinced anyone to be vegan? Did it come as a result of you calling them stupid? Yeah probably not.

RobertRedfort: 692 : This is interesting i think!!! The way i see it your logic implies that people live their lives in accordance to their values. I dont think that is necessarily true which is interesting when debating veganism.

 You wont find any carnivores defending suffering and slaughtering of innocent emotional beings, they can be perfectly aware of farming animals mental states and the meat industrys negative impact on our environment and so on.... but still not give a shit and eat meat ? Not because they dont value wellbeing n stuff and not because they dont understand or arent well informed... just because they dont care.

MustyOreoDropping: 42 : This debate a vegan. Not r/vegancirclejerk

HeliMan27: 1286 : Fair enough. I was assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that someone paying here would know about the most basic, overarching arguments for veganism. But, I'll lay them out:

Human health - many of the health issues our current society deals with (obesity, cancer, imbalanced cholesterol, etc) have animal product consumption as a major contributing factor. 

Environmental issues - animal agriculture (growing food to feed them as well as growing the animals themselves) is a major factor in greenhouse gas release, land use, deforestation, water use/pollution, etc. 

Animal abuse - the vast majority of animal products on grocery store shelves come from factory farming operations. The sheer volume of animals products in the world means, even if the factory farms wanted to treat the animals well, it would be very difficult. Unfortunately, the farms don't even see the animals as loving beings, just products. So these living, feeling beings are treated horribly and raised in absolutely despicable conditions before being killed very early in their lifespan. 

Comment OP has indicated that the temporary satisfaction of their tastebuds is more important any one of these issues, let alone all of them together. Really can't form any logical argument against that level of selfishness. 

MustyOreoDropping: 866 : It seems to be almost the EXACT same problem as slavery. They weren't seen as real beings, just objects and we're traded as objects and not empathized with. Animals are in the same boat and I think we need to realize that people don't eat meat for any GOOD reason and people are merely uneducated. People don't eat meat just because they enjoy watching things suffer. They truly are ignorant and if you throw the fact that all they have to argue is that it's delicious then they will reject that as their only reasoning. But if you acknowledge that people would make the change freely if they had all the knowledge available then they are more likely to come to their own ethical conclusion. Don't force these 'horses' to drink their proverbial 'water' because then they will never want to drink again. Act like the water isn't that special and they'll be interested

suworow: 242 : Because I think vegan meals aren't tasty and there is no good source of vegan proteins without a lot of carbs (I try to eat as little of carbs as possible and get my energy from fats). Vegan diet is full of carbs so it's not something for me.

fatdog1111: 401 : You may be interested in this Harvard study: "A low-carbohydrate diet based on animal sources was associated with higher all-cause mortality in both men and women, whereas a vegetable-based low-carbohydrate diet was associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality rates." 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989112/

edit: About 130,000 people followed over 20+ years.

swimviking: 50 : The do it yourself China study says the opposite. 

fatdog1111: 59 : I've read the China Study, but I'm not sure what you mean. 

swimviking: 272 : there is a site where you can actually search for correlation by variable. all cause mortality and total plant bs animal intake are not what people usually say (because of the movie i am sure. ) my favorite is comparing the rate of suicide on total plant vs animal foods. 

fatdog1111: 590 : Oh interesting. I'd imagine suicide would go up in that study as one approaches a vegetarian or especially a vegan diet, since I don't think the Chinese studied were popping B12.

Here's a review article about low-carb diets being linked to significantly higher mortality. It's from PLOS, which is just about the most highly respected source outside of a Cochrane Review.

"We included 17 studies for a systematic review, followed by a meta-analysis using pertinent data. Of the 272,216 people in 4 cohort studies..."
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055030

swimviking: 275 : did it track how much of their low carb diet was plant based?  that is my one major difference from the keto crowd... they place so much value on plant foods. so much research has shown that fiber causes issues. for me, eliminating it has been an incredibly positive change. 

fatdog1111: 543 : I've never seen any research that fiber is bad for health, only the opposite -- that increased fiber intake is inversely associated with mortality. That's why Mayo Clinic has a link called Dietary Fiber: Essential for a Healthy Diet.

What benefits did you experience by lowering your fiber intake?

swimviking: 249 : lots of it cited here: http://highsteaks.com/fiber/

for me it was mostly the bleeding. not as bad as with fruit, but i had cut out fruit years before i cut out green veggies. straining poops are gone too. i spend way less of my life on the toilet. 

fatdog1111: 345 : Thanks for the reference. I finally got around to looking at this. There's only one or two peer-reviewed studies talked about, and the sample size was small. The studies I linked were very large. Still, that doesn't negate your personal experience. Do you tolerate fruit and veg juices? Or ground nuts and seeds? Like peanut or almond butters?  

swimviking: 295 : fruit juices i don’t do well with. my stomach doesn’t get terribly upset with peanut butter but i feel very off after eating it, usually on the next day. nuts are generally tolerated well but also make me feel blah the next day. I can tolerate several foods but my stomach isn’t the only issue. 

fatdog1111: 257 : Do you think you might have this?http://reference.medscape.com/article/944548-overview

Edit: Or, if not hereditary fructose intolerance, fructose malabsorption? https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/news/20030714/fructose-may-cause-digestive-problems#1

swimviking: 3789 : I would say it is possible I have something specific like this, but it would have to be along with rejection of several other carbohydrate foods as well by specific disorders.  And it did not present in childhood with as much effect as in adulthood if that is the case.  (Perhaps growing insulin resistance might have caused it to get worse with age?)  I wouldn't write these conditions you linked to out as a possibility, but I don't see where they mention the pain and blood in the stool (other than saying "and other symptoms") and it doesn't quite explain why potatoes are so hard on me and why beans turn me into an emergency shit-fountain. I think if I have a specific condition it is more likely to be something like a bacterial or fungal infection in my gut that is fed by any form of carbohydrate, rather than being fructose specific.  Of course, maybe I have both...  different carbohydrate foods present with different symptoms for sure.  (fried breading and soda act pretty similar for me).

Reading these links also doesn't make me feel like I am just a special case... after eating this way for so long I truly feel like I am in on a secret-- that red meat is our natural food and the further we stray from it the more unhealthy we become. I feel absolutely terrific and I didn't know that people could feel this optimal.  Even at my athletic peak I never felt this good. With all of the issues with bloating, gas and constipation that I see people discuss on vegetarian forums it just doesn't seem to make sense that anyone would want to eat anything but red meat...  and not all of those people on the forums can be special cases of maladaption or hereditary conditions, can they?

I have always been a competitive swimmer and have always eaten tremendous amounts of food. (since starting keto I have lost about 45 pounds and have gained muscle without lifting weights.) All my life I spent way too much time on the toilet (usually immediately after eating, and often embarrassingly as soon as we got on the highway from a restaurant) until I went keto and then carnivore.  I also had strange spells of fatigue that were not related to tiredness...  it was weakness as though I was being attacked from the inside-- brain fog, drooling, not being able to form a sentence sometimes... once I remember not even being able to hammer a nail after a big breakfast.  I couldn't hammer a fucking nail!!!  

I remember once going to my doctor and trying to explain and they looked at me like I was crazy.  They told me I need to choose "smarter carbs" like a peanut butter sandwich instead of a snickers bar for breakfast (as though a D1 athlete in the middle of nutrition courses for a PE degree just does that...)  This was in my frustration because on my peak race day that I had trained 7 months for I knew that if I ate breakfast I would feel and perform poorly in my meet, and if I ate nothing I would do great.  My coach forced me to eat breakfast and I got pissed enough to go to the doctor to find out what the hell was wrong with me.  I had argued with my nutrition and exercise physiology professors about it and was humiliated by scientific evidence (back before I had access to my own because the internet barely existed at the time.)  Now I know that the studies they showed me were run by the Gatorade Institute of all places, and that despite everything in my textbooks KETONES CAN BE USED AS A FUEL FOR EXERCISE.  (Now at age 43 I swim faster with less training than I did at age 21 on a zero-carb diet.  hmmm.  go figure.)

We have been lied to about food folks.  The politics of food are literally killing us, and the greatest mistake we are making is avoiding saturated animal fats and replacing them with all forms of sugar/carbohydrate and manufactured oils.



saltedpecker: 300 : Tast depends on how well you can cook.

Carbs aren't inherently bad. You can get a normal amount of protein without eating a lot of carbs on a vegan diet pretty easily. If you want more protein still, there are lots of vegan options like nuts, seeds, soy, tofu, some legumes like chickpeas and beans.

suworow: 799 : Hi.

>nuts, seeds

You're right, but that's rather a snack.

>soy, tofu

I'm afraid of phytoestrogens.

>chickpeas 

That's 60g of carbs, 7g of protein per 100g.

>beans

That's 20g of carbs, 7g of protein per 100g.

I eat 80g of proteins/day so that would be roughly 0.6kg of chickpeas and 0.6kg of beans, this gives 6 * 60g + 6 * 20g = 480g of carbs. That's a lot! On the other side, if I choose meat (~20g of proteins/100g) and eggs (25g of proteins per four eggs), that's no carbs. Of course I eat some carbs during the day (from vegetables and fruits). 

Vegans eat enormous quantities of carbs. I don't say that carbs are bad in general, but for me, fat as a source of energy works better. 

Eating a lot of meat can be bad, but I try to do cook it by myself and eat a lot of wild fishes.






Xrystofer: 417 : > phytoestrogens

Phytoestrogens block real estrogens. You would have to eat a lot of Phytoestrogens to fuck up your hormones. 

Mic the Vegan has a good informative video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_UdM0RedwI

>Eating a lot of meat can be bad

Eating meat even in small quantities is bad for you, because you do something in moderation doesn't mean that it is healthy.

Like smoking in moderation for example.

You don't eat only beans and chickpeas of course.

howlin: 213 : > I'm afraid of phytoestrogens.

Are you sure this is a rational fear? The results are mixed on  any negative effects on normal, healthy adults.  And meat and dairy are full of hormones with much more bioactivity.

SilentmanGaming: 23 : /r/veganketo is a thing

Lapster69: 339 : All spices and herbs are vegan, you aren't missing out on any flavours as a vegan. Vegan diets are perfectly healthy, there's no problem with a high amount of carbs. Even so, it's still possible to be a low carb vegan, have a look on Google. Bottom line is can you justify inflicting suffering on others when you can easily avoid doing so?

None: 9 : [deleted]

fatdog1111: 1260 : > Also, I love beans, but I can't digest beans very well at all.

My family used to have the same experience--very much so!--but by gradually adding more and more beans to our diets, we eliminated this problem. Eventually, one's gut microbes adjust, and when they do, they are a lot more healthful for us. 

https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-develop-a-healthy-gut-ecosystem/

Last night, we had black bean soup and fresh cilantro with salad and fruit. The night before, we had tacos with "meat" filling I made from ground seeds -- surprisingly good! For lunch, I just had rainbow quinoa, kale, red peppers and pineapple, and I packed my daughter a hummus wrap. Some of my favorite foods used to be cheese, pork roast, chateaubriand, and filet mignon and blue cheese. If I can love being vegan, anyone can! :) My mom went vegan at 70 and loves it too, and she was meat and potatoes all her life. The physical and mental health benefits have been tremendous, and our tastes have changed so much. 

You may never want to move vegan, but I just wanted to let you know others have overcome these same concerns and are very happy now. You raise real problems, but they are temporary ones until one learns to eat differently and tastes and gut microbes change. 

PuppetMaster: 352 : >And I'm not the original poster, but carbs make my mood swing like crazy  
  
Does this include whole food carbs, fruit and starches like root vegetables?  Or is this mainly based off experience with processed carbs?  
  
I ask because there's a big difference between processed carbs (junk food, flour, noodles) and whole food carbs (fruit & tubers)


None: 9 : [deleted]

PuppetMaster: 379 : There's a growing mountain of evidence backing whole foods plant based diets improving QOL of many people suffering from food based diseases / issues. The reason I asked is because I haven't seen anyone having health issues with whole food plants yet.  If you have any interest on this topic What the Health on netflix covers some of the science behind it.  Thanks for your time.

overwhelmily: 718 : Just take a quick gander at the fact checking done on the movie you’re citing. Sources are great, but sources that have been fact checked are *far better.* 

https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&hl=en-us&q=what%20the%20health%20review%20fact%20check&ved=0ahUKEwjJxcPUieHWAhUHYiYKHTJmCEMQsKwBCI0BKAAwFQ&biw=375&bih=628

If you want to prove your point, research the sources before assuming their correct. Fact checking is a glorious and important thing. 

It should also be noted that I haven’t seen the movie, so I really can’t argue specifics. I just think it’s incredibly important to make sure you’re using sources presenting data that is factually sound. That goes for anyone on either side of the issue. 



PuppetMaster: 1095 : I have seen most of the studies referenced in the movie before it was released.  I also keep up to date on info published by the doctors in the movie.  While the movie is not perfect and you could debate some of the minor parts it gets the really important parts. It's great to show people what can really happen to your health on the standard diet and how alot of the science that shows this is not mainstream (outside of the scientific community) knowledge yet.  

  
There's alot of debunking done by many people on this movie that are basically saying it's BS without actually proving it.  when they do back of their disproving statements they use studies that are flawed such as the egg and cholesterol studies that show no association to cvd. There's alot of resources out there that show why these egg and cholesterol studies are flawed you can easily find out for yourself if you're interested.  
  
edit: if you want to look at the science outside of the movie check out nutritionfacts.org
  
Normally I would recommend the movie as a primer then you can get more into the science 

   

overwhelmily: 1172 : The doctors in the movie, as far as I’ve seen in what I’ve read about it, are all vegan. Immediate bias. 

You’re mentioning “important parts” and minor details, but as I said, I haven’t seen the movie. I’ve only heard the hype it caused and the subsequent fact checking that shows how flawed it is. It doesn’t matter what your points are. If you can’t drive your point home with scientific fact, it’s irrelevant. I’m not saying the movie is wrong, I’m just saying there are much better sources (scientific journals, published/peer-reviewed studies, etc) that have been fact-checked and passed. 

If you want to carry a point Home, you gotta walk on solid ground. Citing a clearly flawed source to try and change someone’s mind isn’t going to do much good. All they have to do is one google search, and they’ll feel justified in their position. Anecdotal “evidence” and blogs say a lot, as do movies and TV, but unless the science is factual, it means nothing. 

Not at all trying to argue the context of your point, whether or not I am vegan is irrelevant. My only point is that convincing someone that they’re wrong requires proof. This movie simply doesn’t offer that. 

PuppetMaster: 1473 : >The doctors in the movie, as far as I’ve seen in what I’ve read about it, are all vegan. Immediate bias.
  
You are dismissing actual science here without a reason besides, they eat too many plants. As far as I know they are plant based not vegan.

> I’m not saying the movie is wrong, I’m just saying there are much better sources (scientific journals, published/peer-reviewed studies, etc) that have been fact-checked and passed.  
  
The movie is a consolidation of much of the science (peer reviewed studies) behind negatives aspects of eating meat and dairy.  
  
> Citing a clearly flawed source to try and change someone’s mind isn’t going to do much good. All they have to do is one google search, and they’ll feel justified in their position. Anecdotal “evidence” and blogs say a lot, as do movies and TV, but unless the science is factual, it means nothing.  
  
You think it's cleared flawed because you can google what the health fact check and read blog posts and articles stating that it's flawed. This is very lazy and you can use this method to prove any bias you want. This is insufficient evidence to prove it's clearly flawed, and without you providing it the claim can be dismissed.
  
What you really need to do is ignore all of those articles and read the studies themselves and make your own determination.  Or my original suggestion watch the movie, then go to nutritionfacts.org to look at the science behind the claims in the movie for yourself.


overwhelmily: 1267 : 1 - plant-based is still a bias. Unless they included doctors with opposing opinions, or at the very least included arguments from the other side, it is biased. 

2 - Interpretation, not consolidation. Consolidation would literally be a list of the conclusions of the studies with no embellishment. That is not the case here. It is Interpretation, all done by doctors with the same bias. 

3 - lazy doesn’t = insufficient. 

I will not ignore articles written by people with a better understanding of anatomy and physiology, but I will fact check them, just as I did for this movie. If I watch the movie, I’m going to do it while looking for the scientific evidence of the claims. But again, this isn’t about the content. It’s about the source. 

The movie simply isn’t reputable. I’m not at all saying your point is incorrect, either. I’m saying that an argument that includes a source should have a *reputable and direct* source. This movie is neither. 

Edit: I’m not dismissing “real science” based on the fact that the doctors all eat the same diet. I’m acknowledging the fact that people who all have very similar beliefs on healthy diets can’t give an unbiased opinion on what is or isn’t healthy. Unless you include the opposing side, there is always a bias. 

PuppetMaster: 785 : > 2 - Interpretation, not consolidation. Consolidation would literally be a list of the conclusions of the studies with no embellishment. That is not the case here. It is Interpretation, all done by doctors with the same bias.  
  
You should watch the movie before making this claim.  You have no idea what you are talking about.  
  
http://www.whatthehealthfilm.com/facts/
  
  
> 3 - lazy doesn’t = insufficient.
  
It clearly is because it's the exact same sources you criticize in your previous statements.  
  >Anecdotal “evidence” and blogs say a lot, as do movies and TV, but unless the science is factual, it means nothing.
  
Next    

> The movie simply isn’t reputable. 
  
Provide evidence. The doctors featured are clearly reputable in their respective research fields. 

overwhelmily: 677 : If all they do is discuss the Study, without *any embellishment or their own insight*, sure. But I don’t have to watch the movie to know that isn’t the case. 

A google search provides blogs, yes, but also other reputable sources. A facts page *from the movies own site* is *obviously* biased towards the movie. Pretty poor choice to cite that if you’re trying to prove the movies credibility. 

Evidence would be... in any of the aforementioned reputable sources. Yeah, sure, maybe the doctors are “reputable,” but that doesn’t negate their bias. 

</discussion> 

I’m done here. I’ve said the same thing with different words too many times to think this could be productive. 

PuppetMaster: 284 : Ill make it easy for you then.  Name me one reputable source that fact checks what the health and comes to the conclusion the movie is factually incorrect in terms of increasing risk for heart disease, cancer and many other diseases accosciated with dietary Cholesterol and sat fat.

[Credibility ](https://www.quora.com/Is-sciencebasedmedicine-org-a-credible-website). Read the answer. 



PuppetMaster: 62 : Thanks I will read it. The top Google results were all garbage

PuppetMaster: 643 : The point of the facts page was to link to the scientific journals they reference and to demonstrate they say what is in the abstract. For example WHO has a study on processed meat classifying it as a type 1 carcinogen. It's just a statement without embellishment  which the move  uses many such examples like this to paint it's story. But you aren't interested in that because you already determined they are all biased and untrustworthy. You would rather listen to zdogg's,  time magazines and many others like joe Rogan Chris kressers very ignorant opinion on the movie which is not backed by the scientific community involved or literature

overwhelmily: 417 : You’re assuming a lot of things about my personal beliefs that you don’t even know to be true. You don’t even know whether or not I’m vegan, you’re just assuming. Please remember I ended the discussion. No interest whatsoever in continuing, as you either outright refuse to admit the flaws here, or are too stupid to understand them. Bias is bias is bias is bias, and bias makes unreliable data. 

Period. 

Goodbye. 

PuppetMaster: 724 : I will reply to anyone that made it this far then, not you directly. You can't name a source that is reputable to show the documentary has unreliable data and can be completely dismissed, you just assert it does. This assertion without evidence can be dismissed. If you think Robb Wolf or Chris Kresser are reputable sources you are mis-informed. They make a living off the Paleo diet and what the health directly challenges that.  Blog posts from 'gurus' and magazine articles are not sufficient evidence to dismiss the science referenced in what the health.  If anyone can provide any counter evidence in the form of peer reviewed studies that goes directly against a main point in what the health I would like to read it.

overwhelmily: 688 : Oh my god, hush.

I don’t even know who the two people you mentioned are, so no, I don’t think they’re reputable. I have no idea who they are, so I have no idea what their reputation is. You have no idea what my beliefs on diet are, or who is reputable or not, so please stop assuming you know. 

I also *never* said that the documentary can be completely dismissed. You’re putting words in my mouth. I’m saying that when you are arguing, use the type of sources that you are requesting. Period. I’m not searching for a research article to prove this movie wrong, because my whole point isn’t about the fucking movie. It’s about your argument and it’s flawed “evidence.” 

Fuck off, dude.

ZDTreefur: 1427 : > If abstaining from murder, rape and theft would not accomplish anything in my life, would it be okay to continue doing so?

In what world does that not accomplish anything? I don't even understand the question, since you live in a society that requires specific rules in order to function. This is just terrible reasoning, mate. Can you explain how your question is at all relevant, please?

> You would have better chances of not having an early death or getting a preventable disease. 

Not worthwhile to me. I'd rather have a life of occasional cakes, even though they can be unhealthy. I'd rather have a life of delicious food, even if it's not the healthiest.

My life has me maintaining a *good enough* diet. I don't need to have the *healthiest* diet. I go to the doctor 3 times a year, and my blood work has always been great. Like I said, it don't accomplish anything worthwhile in *my* life. If you need to have the absolute healthiest diet, go for it. No skin off my back, and using just that metric, my diet should have no skin off your back either.

> You would much lesser footprint on the environment.

Considering that for environmental shifts to actually occur, massive government enforced regulations need to take place, in order for the offending companies to change their actions, my individual footprint is completely meaningless. 

I'm not seeing these as a reason to have a life-changing dietary shift.

Xrystofer: 3195 : > In what world does that not accomplish anything? I don't even understand the question, since you live in a society that requires specific rules in order to function. This is just terrible reasoning, mate. Can you explain how your question is at all relevant, please?

It's a hypothetical scenario, it doesn't necessarily have to be true. What matter is that you have to be logically consistent or you have double standards and basically you are saying that the same justification doesn't apply to other contexts without pointing out a difference. Let's take the dictator of North Korea as an example, he can do whatever he wants and not murdering people, doesn't really accomplishes anything in his life.

>Not worthwhile to me. I'd rather have a life of occasional cakes, even though they can be unhealthy. I'd rather have a life of delicious food, even if it's not the healthiest.

Vegans can eat the same foods and actually eat more and not be restricted. You would overall feel better satisfaction, being healthy is also a pleasant side effect.

>My life has me maintaining a good enough diet. I don't need to have the healthiest diet. I go to the doctor 3 times a year, and my blood work has always been great. Like I said, it don't accomplish anything worthwhile in my life. 

The vegan group reported improvements in general health (p = 0.002), physical functioning (p = 0.001), mental health (p = 0.03), vitality (p = 0.004), and overall diet satisfaction (p < 0.001) compared with the control group. The vegan group also reported a decrease in food costs (p = 0.003), and increased difficulty finding foods when eating out (p = 0.04) compared with the control group. The vegan group reported a 40-46% decrease in health-related productivity impairments at work (p = 0.03) and in regular daily activities (p = 0.004).
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20389060

>If you need to have the absolute healthiest diet, go for it. No skin off my back, and using just that metric, 

This is a misconception about being vegan, vegan foods are not necessarily healthy, they are healthier compared to animal products though.

>my diet should have no skin off your back either.

Does this expression means that it doesn't affect me and therefore I should mind my own business?

First off, an omnivorous diet is not sustainable and we are heading towards extinction and therefore it does definitely effect me personally.

Secondly, if you were a victim, you would wish that someone would come to your rescue and therefore you are giving me the permission  to speak up about an atrocity that is taking place.

>Considering that for environmental shifts to actually occur, massive government enforced regulations need to take place, in order for the offending companies to change their actions, my individual footprint is completely meaningless.
I'm not seeing these as a reason to have a life-changing dietary shift.

That's like saying that we should not recycle, donate or use public transportation because the footprint of a single person is negligible. Obviously if everyone acted like this, we would have no future. If you want to see a change in the world, you have to be that change first. 

ZDTreefur: 2575 : > It's a hypothetical scenario, it doesn't necessarily have to be true.

In order for it to be worth talking about, it does. I pointed out that there is no world where you live in a society, completely disobey societal laws, and your life is not impacted by it. I specifically said this "scenario" of yours doesn't even make sense, so how is your response to say "your justification doesn't work unless you point out differences." I didn't point out a difference, I called into question the scenario itself, saying it didn't make sense on its face. That's something you need to answer. 

Bring up North Korea only compounds the problem, as my statement was an "I" statement. It said "I do not believe it accomplishes anything in my life." My life, as somebody who lives within the US borders, and is part of American society. If you want to talk about North Korea, we can. But unfortunately that's not actually really relevant on this sub about veganism.

> being healthy is also a pleasant side effect.

As I very explicitly stated already, I am already healthy. As are many people who eat meat regularly. Vegans do not corner the market on healthy bodies. There's not much to say on this topic. My diet is healthy enough for my needs, so I am not in the market to look for a healthier diet. So you won't convince me on this ground.

> That's like saying that we should not recycle, donate or use public transportation because the footprint of a single person is negligence.

Yes, it is. I'm waiting for an argument against it, not just pointing out other areas with excessive amounts of self-congratulatory but ultimately meaningless actions.

> Obviously if everyone acted like this, we would have no future.

Incorrect, since we are developing the technology to save ourselves. Society as a whole is working towards a livable future. The individual within society doesn't need to sacrifice anything.

> If you want to see a change in the world, you have to be that change first.

Also incorrect, since I explicitly explained to you about the necessity for governmental regulations that would be capable of enforcing crucial changes. Otherwise, nothing will be accomplished. You can easily petition your government, be involved with the process without doing the actions yourself. You can champion causes that do not directly harm or benefit you. That's how democracies work. It's about your words, not your personal lives.

You aren't really answering the criticisms I have of your reasoning. Twice you said something that I very explicitly responded to, but you ignored.

Xrystofer: 4872 : >In order for it to be worth talking about, it does.

According to the law of thought no, it doesn't state that a hypothetical scenario has to be true. 

>I pointed out that there is no world where you live in a society, completely disobey societal laws, and your life is not impacted by it.

It doesn't matter, because it is a hypothetical and if you were consistent you would accept the same treatment if the justification was present or otherwise you are contradicting yourself.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction

> I didn't point out a difference, 

I know, what I am saying is that you need to either point a difference that negates the argument, to reject it or accept it. Those are the choices that you have available.


>I called into question the scenario itself, saying it didn't make sense on its face. That's something you need to answer.

You are simply dodging the question because you do not wish to contradict yourself. Obviously no sane person would accept the murder of human beings as a moral action if ceasing the activity wouldn't accomplish anything in the life of the perpetrator.

Your argument is basically this, Doing X (not eating animals), doesn't accomplish anything in my life and therefore it is justified. 

Therefore by changing X and presenting the same justification, that action according to the logical consistency of your own argument should be ''Okay''. Insert rape, murder into the equation and see how it works for you. This is insanely easy to understand.

>Bring up North Korea only compounds the problem, as my statement was an "I" statement. It said "I do not believe it accomplishes anything in my life." My life, as somebody who lives within the US borders, and is part of American society. If you want to talk about North Korea, we can. But unfortunately that's not actually really relevant on this sub about veganism.

How is your present location relevant? You presented a justification ''It would not accomplish anything in my life'' and I simply applied that justification into a context that puts you in the prospective of the victim, the location is not relevant to your own argument.

>As I very explicitly stated already, I am already healthy. As are many people who eat meat regularly. Vegans do not corner the market on healthy bodies. There's not much to say on this topic. My diet is healthy enough for my needs, so I am not in the market to look for a healthier diet. So you won't convince me on this ground.

Someone who has a progressive disease is hardly healthy and because you are relatively health at the moment, it doesn't mean that you will also be in the future. You should not wait to contract a disease to change your diet, the time is now.

>Yes, it is. I'm waiting for an argument against it, not just pointing out other areas with excessive amounts of self-congratulatory but ultimately meaningless actions.

I did present an argument, it is right there. 

''That's like saying that we should not recycle, donate or use public transportation because the footprint of a single person is negligence.''

This is basically an appeal to futility and therefore everyone should continue to destroy the environment and change will never happen if we adopt this philosophy.

>Incorrect, since we are developing the technology to save ourselves. Society as a whole is working towards a liveable future. The individual within society doesn't need to sacrifice anything.

/Face palm.

No one should take any action whatsoever, the society will solve all of our problems by it's self, bravo at this diamond of a logical argument.

>Also incorrect, since I explicitly explained to you about the necessity for governmental regulations that would be capable of enforcing crucial changes. Otherwise, nothing will be accomplished. You can easily petition your government, be involved with the process without doing the actions yourself.

Here is how you are contradicting yourself, you are asking me to create a petition and send it to the government in order to change people, yet you are making an appeal to futility and you do not want to change your habits, but you are okay with the government creating restrictions for your actions.

>u can champion causes that do not directly harm or benefit you. That's how democracies work. It's about your words, not your personal lives.

EXACTLY, that is how democracy works, yet you are making an appeal to futility and that our footprint is negligible and that we should not change ourselves. If you do not change yourself, why should anyone change? Let's continue towards extinction.

>You aren't really answering the criticisms I have of your reasoning. Twice you said something that I very explicitly responded to, but you ignored.

You are refusing to answer whatever you accept the hypothetical or not, yet it's me who is ignoring your points?

WikiTextBot: 914 : **Law of noncontradiction**

This article uses forms of logical notation. For a concise description of the symbols used in this notation, see List of logic symbols.

In classical logic, the law of non-contradiction (LNC) (or the law of contradiction or the principle of non-contradiction (PNC), or the principle of contradiction) is the second of the three classic laws of thought. It states that contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time, e.g.

ZDTreefur: 6901 : > It doesn't matter, because it is a hypothetical and if you were consistent you would accept the same treatment if the justification was present or otherwise you are contradicting yourself.

There is a serious problem with the reasoning used here. If the scenario you attempted to give is not relevant, it's a non sequitur. Therefore there is no reason to entertain it in the slightest. *You think apples should be eaten as a fruit? Ah, but what about rocks?Rocks are not delicious at all, therefore they apples should not be eaten.* This is the extent of what you are doing. 

It's a scenario that has no bearing on my comment, since it's not something that's possible in reality. There is no reason at all to entertain something that doesn't exist. That's an absurd thing to claim from you. I don't care to answer something that does not exist in reality, since morality is only concerned with reality, as is human interaction. I'll stick to scenarios that actually matter to moral thought.

> Your argument is basically this, Doing X (not eating animals), doesn't accomplish anything in my life and therefore it is justified.

Here's where you go wrong first. I am not making an argument. You are. I said I'm not convinced changing my lifestyle is something that accomplishes anything. Another way of putting it is, *I am not convinced by vegan arguments that I should alter my way of life.* A negative position on an argument isn't an argument. It's just not accepting the affirmative position. 

> Therefore by changing X and presenting the same justification, that action according to the logical consistency of your own argument should be ''Okay''. Insert rape, murder into the equation and see how it works for you. This is insanely easy to understand.

And here's the second place you go wrong, by presenting a scenario that doesn't exist. Living within a society with moral laws, and not being morally judged by that society? Those are the contradictions. Who's actions in a society aren't judged by that society's moral system?

> This is basically an appeal to futility

No, it wasn't "basically" an appeal to futility. It was pointing to other examples of things that my worldview would *also* deem meaningless. You could point to a hundred other actions that I believe are meaningless. How does that in itself form an argument against not believing those things are meaningless? You need to actually demonstrate why these actions are meaningful for me to do.

> /Face palm.

Oh, we're doing facepalms now to passively-aggressively show when we disagree with the other person, instead of simply explaining why you think they are wrong? Alright, if you want. I wanted to keep this civil, but sure. Let's be immature.

> No one should take any action whatsoever, the society will solve all of our problems by it's self, bravo at this diamond of a logical argument.

/Face palm.

You need to stop for a second and actually consider the words you are reading. You are not attempting to understand the meaning, but instead just thrusting out the first thought that came to your head in your knee-jerk reaction.

Consider that we live in a society. Consider that a society is a collection, a whole of many parts. Consider that each part does not have universal expertise in every field of science (and art and comedy and etc et al. No individual is a paragon.) Consider there are people in specific fields, that have the expertise to solve problems relevant to their field. Consider the people who do not have the expertise in that field, will, by necessity, rely on those people to do their part for the whole. 

What is the problem? We need food. What is the solution? Farmers do their part. What is the problem? People are attacking us. Soldiers do their part. What is the problem? We need labor in this factory. Those people do their job. What is the problem? We want to go to the moon. Aerospace engineers do their job. What is the problem? We are burning excessive amounts of fossil fuel for our planet. Solution? Well, you are arguing that each individual must change their diet to become vegan in order to stop it. I think our species is already on the right track, and that we are developing (we as in society, a royal we. The individuals are the people who have the expertise to be tasked with solving this problem) the necessary technology that will ameliorate the excessive rates of greenhouse gas emission from our reckless industrialization.

the question you must ask yourself, is what do you believe will be *faster*, and why? On one hand, a way to solve our excessive fossil fuel problem is to develop and refine the necessary technology. Renewable energy, electric cars/boats/trains, hydroponics, methane eliminating and/or capturing filters for livestock. These are all remedies for our problem. These are all obtainable. These are not pipe dreams. These are all possible right now. And these are all being developed and funded by governments. 

On the other hand, a way to fix our problem is to.. make the entire world vegan? Change the hearts and minds of the entire global population towards a source of calorie that doesn't use livestock at all?

How much education do you have on social movements? Do you believe this is an obtainable goal within the time frame? Because right now, we are already too far gone by 2050. Some scientists even believe that right now, it's too late and we will have changed the world irrevocably already, and we are in damage control at this point.

So of the two pathways to solving this problem, I believe there is a much stronger case for developing the necessary technology as an actual obtainable goal within the time frame, than changing the entire globe vegan. This is why I have not been *convinced* by the vegan's position, and therefore do not see the need to change my behavior.

> You are refusing to answer whatever you accept the hypothetical or not, yet it's me who is ignoring your points?

/Face palm.

1. I have been directly addressing the hypothetical, criticising it, regardless of if I chose to answer it or not. Therefore, I have not been ignoring it.

2. There are two direct points I made, and your response was to repeat the exact thing my point was addressing. The first was me telling you I am already healthy, so I don't care to "upgrade" my diet. You answered by telling me I will be healthy if I switch. The second was me telling that being involved in the government process can change the world, even if you do not directly engage in the action you want change. You answered by dribbling out that glib platitude, "you must be the change you see in the world" despite that not necessarily being true. 

Do you see now how you've been just kinda skipping over what I said, and saying exactly what I rebuffed, as if I didn't type anything at all? Can you at least admit that you erred in this tiny little area?

Deinemudda500: 109 : I really enjoy reading your comments. You are intelligent and present your arguments in a civil way. Awesome!

Xrystofer: 1485 : > There is a serious problem with the reasoning used here. If the scenario you attempted to give is not relevant, it's a non sequitur. Therefore there is no reason to entertain it in the slightest. You think apples should be eaten as a fruit? Ah, but what about rocks?Rocks are not delicious at all, therefore they apples should not be eaten. This is the extent of what you are doing.

Apples are edible, rocks are NOT, If rocks were edible, you would be able to eat them. do you see that there's a trait that justifies the difference in the treatment of apples and rocks. JESUS CHRIST.

The trait that something is ''delicious'' or that it is a ''fruit'' is irrelevant. The relevant trait is being ''edible''.

X is edible, therefore we can consume them.


Apples are edible, therefore we can consume them.


Rocks are not edible, therefore we cannot consume them.


If rocks were edible, we could consume them.

The fact that something is delicious, doesn't justifies the difference in treatment and it is an arbitrary trait on this context, like your own argument.

Do you understand how it logically follows through?

You name a difference and you negate the argument, it is simple. I am not going to read the rest of your post until you address my argument.

If not doing action X doesn't accomplish anything worthwhile in my life, it is justified.

Insert Rape, Eating humans, Infanticide in the equation. You can either name a difference, accept it or reject your own argument.


ZDTreefur: 1848 : How are you defining "address my argument."?

I have been responding to that specific non sequitur since the beginning. I have been addressing it. You not being satisfied with my response is not analogous with me ignoring it. The problem is you can only conceive of me answering in this one specific way, since you believe your argument to be valid. Since I did not respond on the vein you wanted me to, you don't see me as "addressing" it. But I have not made a comment yet that did not respond to it.

> I am not going to read the rest of your post until you address my argument.

I go further in my comment. Read it, since it's there. You going through the simple logic of comparing rocks with apples completely missed the point I was making. You are too focused on the simple logic, and not encapsulating the overall argument. Essentially, you are missing the forest for the trees.

Do I need to actually repeat my comment within this comment, just so you don't read my original comment? I think that's a silly thing to ask of somebody.

> Insert Rape, Eating humans, Infanticide in the equation. You can either name a difference, accept it or reject your own argument.

This is the problem, since inserting these things into an equation that doesn't even exist to begin with is where you are making a non-relevant argument. The essential part is that "I have not been convinced by vegan arguments." Does that phrase change your stance, and allow you to understand how you've been grossly misinterpreting my original comment?

Seriously, read my comment. I go further. Taking a single paragraph at the beginning, and then not reading further is...dumb. I'm sorry, but that's just dumb. You have no idea what is written further, if it answers you or not. You are just asking me to repeat what I said instead of simply reading it the first time.


Xrystofer: 1309 : What an intellectually dishonest person.

You won't name a difference, accept nor reject your own argument, you are attempting to dodge my question and won't give me a straight answer whatever it is okay or not.

Not only did I gave you the logical formula of your own argument, I even presented you with a real life example of Kim Jong-Un.

Well Kim Jong Un, doesn't accomplish anything in his life if he cease to murder his own people either, I guess that it's fine.

>This is the problem, since inserting these things into an equation that doesn't even exist to begin with is where you are making a non-relevant argument.

They exist and I even presented you with a real life example. I think you do not understand that the justification that you presented can be used in a variety of contexts to justify a lot of things and they do not have to be relevant to one another.

Let's imagine that I was a serial killer in the USA and it was impossible for the authorities to catch me, well stopping this activity wouldn't accomplish anything in my life either, so I guess it's fine to continue to do so.

The fact that this is an absurd hypothetical is irrelevant, what is important is to have consistent logic and either present me with a difference between humans and animals, accept or reject your argument.

ZDTreefur: 1072 : Bro, jesus christ man. I've explained so many times I object to the very squestion, and I don't think it's relevant. In what way does that make me "intellectually dishonest"?

Here, let me do you a favor since you are so hung up on that phrase to the point of insanity.

I'll rephrase it, but the meaning doesn't actually change.

"I have not been convinced by the arguments I've heard from vegans, to give me sufficient reason to change my diet."

There. That's it, man. Now please let your brain slide away from that. It's such a nonsensically useless debate to have. Nothing is accomplished with you hung up on that. Move on. That one doesn't actually matter. You are arguing with somebody who said you haven't convinced them, trying to claim they are being logically inconsistent because of it. Move on to the actual arguments, now. I rephrased it so you shouldn't be hung up on it anymore. It's the same meaning I was conveying, just something that doesn't apparently trigger your brain into a meltdown.

Can we move on to something that is worth talking about now?



Xrystofer: 352 : Do you accept the position of being a livestock for an alien race?

If you do not, please name the difference present in animals that if it was present in you, would justify treating you in the same way that you propose.

Here is my argument, you would not accept the same treatment done to you, therefore inflicting it to someone else is inconsistent.

ZDTreefur: 1816 : > you would not accept the same treatment done to you, therefore inflicting it to someone else is inconsistent.

So the golden rule. The golden rule works within a society because we are capable of putting ourselves in the shoes of fellow human beings that share our cognitive and emotional awareness, and therefore not want something bad to happen to us, so we can empathize with the other person. This is the basis of social values, even. No theft within the city, because then you could also be the victim of theft. So nobody can do it, for example.

But how does this allow me to compare the hypothetical alien v. human, with human v. animals? I'm not able to see things from the animals point of view. I have no experience as an animal. You're asking me to put my human cognition into the life of a non-human, and then determine what their experiences and desires are.

Sure, there are definitely *some* similarities, primarily ones connected to base emotions like pain and lust and hunger. But I don't see the evidence that animals suffer the same existential crisis raised on farms, as humans do.

This isn't to mention that humans can very easily be conditioned for subservience. Kings have always had their servants, lords their vassals, husbands their downtrodden wives, masters their slaves. Some forms of subservience has been more brutal than others, but people are capable of adapting, and if born into it, can be emotionally stable and content living out a life as a servant, or maid, or in a harem.

So I would personally resist alien farming. But I imagine if they knew what they were doing, they could potentially enslave the human population, and we'd be able to adapt to it (as a species, through multiple generations). Much like the livestock we humans use, and have bred for thousands of years.

If we want to see if an argument is valid or not, we have to apply it to ourselves. If we do not accept the same justification done to our selves or other contexts, then the justification is not consistent and you are in violation of the second law of logic, the law of non contradiction.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_thought#The_law_of_non-contradiction
You are basically saying that it is up to you to apply when and where, the justification is valid based on arbitrary traits.

>Sure, there are definitely some similarities, primarily ones connected to base emotions like pain and lust and hunger. But I don't see the evidence that animals suffer the same existential crisis raised on farms, as humans do.

Sure, I admit that they probably do not suffer in the same way, or as much as a human would. However, it's not about the quantity of suffering, but the fact that they do suffer. That's what makes it wrong to cause them suffering in the first place.

Imagine that a human suffering was equal to animal suffering, would that make it okay to cause the human to suffer? Do you see how those beliefs are inconsistent and create a contradiction when the same justification is applied to a human being?

>This isn't to mention that humans can very easily be conditioned for subservience. Kings have always had their servants, lords their vassals, husbands their downtrodden wives, masters their slaves. Some forms of subservience has been more brutal than others, but people are capable of adapting, and if born into it, can be emotionally stable and content living out a life as a servant, or maid, or in a harem. 

A human can adapt to a life of slavery, does that make it moral though? Unless you were indoctrinated since childhood into slavery, I doubt any sane person wouldn't value their freedom.

>So I would personally resist alien farming. But I imagine if they knew what they were doing, they could potentially enslave the human population, and we'd be able to adapt to it (as a species, through multiple generations). Much like the livestock we humans use, and have bred for thousands of years.

This is my point. no one would accept this treatment done to themselves, Therefore you are creating a contradiction when you present this as justification to treat animals in the way that you propose.

ZDTreefur: 1603 : Really not sure how the law of non-contradiction applies here at all, since my argument is that the scenario is not the same, by virtue of the differences between species, between cognitive awareness, that I don't think there's enough valid reason to believe we can claim our own experiences and desires are directly translatable to animals. It seems you need quite a few presuppositions for that believe to take hold in your mind. I prefer to be a skeptic.

> Imagine that a human suffering was equal to animal suffering, would that make it okay to cause the human to suffer? 

Of course not, because of the nature of morality, and how moral agents within a society have moral rights afforded to them, and things outside of society do not. Again, I don't see the same connection since I see humans as distinctly different from other animals. So that question can't hold any weight in my mind, or worldview, and the main reason why I struggle to find a reason to care about the suffering of another animals.

> A human can adapt to a life of slavery, does that make it moral though?

I thought you were asking whether I would "accept" it. I didn't know you are now asking about the morality of the situation. Once we meet another advanced species with their own moral system, we would have to develop an entirely new set of ethics based on our interactions with them. From that, a moral system will be formed that informs our, and their, actions as we share the cosmos. I have no idea what will be moral or not. I won't pretend I, or any of us, are intelligent enough to know that far into the future.



Xrystofer: 2567 : I wanted to answer more thoroughly to your reply.

>Really not sure how the law of non-contradiction applies here at all, since my argument is that the scenario is not the same, by virtue of the differences between species.

You will have to be more specific than that, what difference are you referring to exactly? 

>between cognitive awareness.

Would it be okay to kill humans that have the cognitive awareness of a cow? If not, cognitive awareness is not a relevant trait that justifies their treatment.

>that I don't think there's enough valid reason to believe we can claim our own experiences and desires are directly translatable to animals.

I do not think so either, however they have a will to be free, avoid pain and continue to exist.

>It seems you need quite a few presuppositions for that believe to take hold in your mind. I prefer to be a skeptic.

I am not, I am simply demonstrating that the same justifications are also applicable to humans.  We wouldn't accept the same logic to holocaust humans, therefore we are contradicting ourselves.

>Of course not, because of the nature of morality, 

Morality is subjective and it exists differently in each every of us. What matters is to be logically consistent in your beliefs to justify them.

>and how moral agents within a society have moral rights afforded to them, and things outside of society do not.

This is simply an assertion. who afforded those rights to them? You need to further elaborate on your point.

Also, would it be okay to kill humans that weren't part of a society, nor had moral rights afforded to them? Like indigenous tribes etc.

>I thought you were asking whether I would "accept" it.

It is literally the same, whatever I ask you if you find it moral or if you accept it, there's isn't a difference.

>I didn't know you are now asking about the morality of the situation. Once we meet another advanced species with their own moral system, we would have to develop an entirely new set of ethics based on our interactions with them. From that, a moral system will be formed that informs our, and their, actions as we share the cosmos. I have no idea what will be moral or not. I won't pretend I, or any of us, are intelligent enough to know that far into the future.

Morals are subjective and they exist differently in each and every individual. There isn't a set of ethics to ad here to, we are simply putting your beliefs to the test by applying the justifications into other contexts. If you accept them done to yourself and others, then you are logically consistent.

ZDTreefur: 481 : > This is simply an assertion. who afforded those rights to them? You need to further elaborate on your point.

If you want, we can talk about the nature of morality itself. That would be an argument all its own, though. I am convinced morality is an objective measurement, you believe it's subjective. It's up to you.

This argument would explain why I believe animals that live outside of morality are not justifiably allowed moral protection, due to their lack of moral agency.


Xrystofer: 962 : Just name the difference and I will adjust the argument accordingly. You will realise that no matter what is the difference, as long as you are sentient and you have a will to live, you wouldn't accept your own death unless you are under tremendous suffering.

Do humans have moral value? What is that trait that gives us moral value that is not present in animals?

Would it be okay to kill you if you had a beak?


Would it be okay to kill you if you were illiterate?

Would it be okay to kill you if you had multiple stomachs?


Would it be okay to kill you if you had the IQ of a cow?


Would it be okay to kill you if you had fur?


Would it be okay to kill you if had scales?


Would it be okay to kill you if had horns?





There isn't a difference present in animals, that if we had that difference we would accept our own death. We are simply discriminating against other species based on arbitrary differences, very similarly to sexism and racism. 




ZDTreefur: 458 : > Just name the difference and I will adjust the argument accordingly.

One is human, one is not. I'm asking why we should value the suffering in other animals, and you say because we value it in our own species. But in answering that, you admit the difference yourself. Your very argument hinges on the difference between the two, and your attempt to bridge that difference using empathy.

So why should humans care about the suffering of non-human animals?

Xrystofer: 1811 : >One is human, one is not.

One is black, the other is not. Doesn't this sound similar to you?

You cannot make an appeal to your own group without justifying slavery and the Nazi holocaust. You have to be more specific when naming traits.

>I'm asking why we should value the suffering in other animals, and you say because we value it in our own species.

Why should I value your life if I value my own? 

>But in answering that, you admit the difference yourself.

Well there are differences, however there are no differences that justify the difference in treatment though. I am looking for a specific difference to justify their treatment. 

Let me make an example for you: What is the trait that justifies giving vote rights to someone, that if it wasn't present it would justify not giving vote rights? 

Trait: A comprehension of the political and voting system.

It is justified to not grand vote rights to a retard etc, because he doesn't comprehend politics nor the voting system.

>Your very argument hinges on the difference between the two, and your attempt to bridge that difference using empathy.

My argument is based on logical consistency, you have to name the difference as to why your life has value and animal life doesn't.

>So why should humans care about the suffering of non-human animals?

I am not saying that you should care, you are misunderstanding me. If you claim that human life has value, then you have to name a difference that is present in animals, that if it was present in humans, it would cause to view our lives valueless.

Example: Plants do not have sentience, If I didn't have sentience it would be fine to eat me. I give my self moral value, because I am sentient. Sentience is also present in animals though, therefore by denying them moral value, is inconsistent.

ZDTreefur: 1507 : > One is black, the other is not. Doesn't this sound similar to you?

It doesn't sound similar at all, no. Could you elaborate on which *different* biological species is black and which is not? What is the significance of this?

> Why should I value your life if I value my own?

Because we live within the same society, and follow the same norms, values, and moral laws that govern our interactions with each other. Otherwise we are both living in the state of nature, and both our lives would be forfeit to each other's will. This is why humans collected into societies. It's safer for the individual, and allows us to not have to worry incessantly about a plethora of things, like being stabbed in our sleep for the fur blanket we have.

> If you claim that human life has value, then you have to name a difference that is present in animals, that if it was present in humans, it would cause to view our lives valueless.

Moral agency. This goes back to my offer to talk about the basis of morality, as a person's rights are only afforded when they uphold their moral responsibility. Other animals do not have the comprehension to understand their role in a society, or their responsibilities within. They do not have the moral agency to participate in our society, so to grant them rights without the responsibilities to go along with it would be meaningless. We could, but I see no justification for it. We could also grant rights to ants if we wanted to. But they also wouldn't be able to comprehend.


Xrystofer: 1754 : >It doesn't sound similar at all, no. Could you elaborate on which different biological species is black and which is not? What is the significance of this?

Is being ''white'', ''black'' or ''Jew'', a justification to enslave human beings? You can't appeal to your own group to justify different treatment. You would also not accept an appeal to an alien species to justify your death. You need to spell out specific traits and not make an appeal to a vague trait.

>Because we live within the same society, and follow the same norms, values, and moral laws that govern our interactions with each other. Otherwise we are both living in the state of nature, and both our lives would be forfeit to each other's will. 

Do you suggest that we holocaust humans that do not live in a society?

>Moral agency.

Do you suggest that we holocaust psychopaths, sociopaths, the insane and the demented?

>This goes back to my offer to talk about the basis of morality, as a person's rights are only afforded when they uphold their moral responsibility.

There's plenty of people that do not have moral responsibilities, like the retarded, the insane, the demented etc. Do you suggest that we holocaust them?

>They do not have the moral agency to participate in our society, so to grant them rights without the responsibilities to go along with it would be meaningless. 

Is it okay to holocaust humans that do not have moral agency? Like babies, the demented, the retarded etc.

>We could, but I see no justification for it. We could also grant rights to ants if we wanted to. But they also wouldn't be able to comprehend.

Is it okay to holocaust those who cannot comprehend moral rights?

Do you realise that your arguments can easily justify human atrocities? 

ZDTreefur: 1933 : > Is being ''white'', ''black'' or ''Jew'', a justification to enslave human beings?

Jeez, I can't see the justification in that. If you want to make an argument for enslaving blacks and jews and whites, I'm all ears. But my worldview definitely doesn't account for it.

> Do you suggest that we holocaust humans that do not live in a society?

You seem like a very violent individual. I don't know of any humans that aren't part of human society. Can you point to them, and then explain why your initial thought is slaughter them all?

> Do you suggest that we holocaust psychopaths, sociopaths, the insane and the demented?

I'd rather take the much more measured approach of imprisonment. You need to investigate your aggressive tendencies, maybe you have a bit of sociopathy in you.

> There's plenty of people that do not have moral responsibilities, like the retarded, the insane, the demented etc. Do you suggest that we holocaust them?

No, they are still accountable to the law. Can you point to a deranged individual that is allowed to break the law without punishment?

> Is it okay to holocaust humans that do not have moral agency? Like babies, 

Now you want to go after babies!? They are our offspring, the future of our society. What sense is there in killing our children? Please sir, you are off the deep end now. Contain yourself!

> Is it okay to holocaust those who cannot comprehend moral rights?

Such as animals? We do, don't we? Isn't that exactly what I laid out?

> Do you realise that your arguments can easily justify human atrocities?

The only person attempting to justify human atrocities is you. I take a rational approach, using a comprehensive and coherent moral system that protect fellow humans. You are apparently a person that would use that to become a Nazi. Sorry, but I'd have to fight you if you tried anything violent or abhorrent. It's nothing personal, it's just the moral thing to do. 

Xrystofer: 3876 : >Jeez, I can't see the justification in that. If you want to make an argument for enslaving blacks and jews and whites, I'm all ears. But my worldview definitely doesn't account for it.

Huh? You are making an appeal to your own group to justify treating others differently. By the same logic you can justify treating other human races as slaves as well.

>You seem like a very violent individual.

I am literally making a counter-argument to get through that thick skull of yours, that thinks there's an argument to kill someone who doesn't want to die in a non-survival situation, Jesus christ.

>I don't know of any humans that aren't part of human society. Can you point to them, and then explain why your initial thought is slaughter them all?

Hermits, indigenous tribes etc. Obviously I am trying to demonstrate that the fact that we live in a society is not a relevant trait.

>I'd rather take the much more measured approach of imprisonment. You need to investigate your aggressive tendencies, maybe you have a bit of sociopathy in you.

I am trying to demonstrate that moral agency is not a relevant trait as why someone should be treated differently. Also, not having a moral agency doesn't immediately makes you a criminal, those people can still lead normal lives.

>No, they are still accountable to the law. Can you point to a deranged individual that is allowed to break the law without punishment?

''Society maintains that a person cannot be tried in court if, because of a mental illness or developmental disability, he or she is unable to comprehend the charges or legal proceedings or assist their attorney in their defense. Any officer of the court can request that the court consider the defendant’s “competency” to be tried at any stage of legal proceedings. Note that competency for trial is not the same as determining if the individual is in need of a guardian.''

''Insanity laws are rooted in society’s long held belief that one cannot be held responsible for a crime if they were unable to understand the implications of their actions because of a mental illness or defect. In such cases the individual is found to be Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity or Not Criminally Responsible.''

''Whether found Incompetent or Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity, the court has several options including sending the person to a treatment facility for a specific period of time.''

You are being intellectually lazy and taking my counter arguments as legitimate threats. I am simply trying to demonstrate that moral agency is not a relevant trait to treat someone else differently in this context.

>Such as animals? We do, don't we? Isn't that exactly what I laid out?

Babies, retards, the demented, the insane, indigenous tribes etc.

Failed at logical consistency. >.> 

You have failed to understand that those positions are based on your own argumentation, perhaps before you speak you need to think what you say thoroughly. Every single justification that you present to kill animals will lead to absurd positions. Obviously no sane human being would accept those justifications when applied to human beings, It simply shows the hypocrisy of those justifications. You are in violation of the second law of thought, the law of of non-contradiction.

ZDTreefur: 6415 : > Huh? You are making an appeal to your own group to justify treating others differently. By the same logic you can justify treating other human races as slaves as well.

Which group am I appealing to? The answer is the group that understand it’s actually part of a group. The ones with the cognitive ability to uphold its own moral responsibilities inside a society, in order to retain its moral rights society grants. You are actually arguing that things that capable of understanding its actions are being “treated differently”, and this is wrong. There has to be a baseline level of comprehension for something to be protected society, unless you have a good reason. Otherwise it’s irrational. You really aren’t making the argument you think you are making, by trying to absurdly apply it to human races. Different races are still human, and understand the concepts of right and wrong inside a society. Different races have moral agency, therefore your argument that races are an analog to animals is completely untenable.

> Hermits, indigenous tribes etc.

Sorry, but hermits and indigenous tribes aren’t allowed to murder anybody. You aren’t understanding the concept of moral agency if you believe they are not part of human society, even if they are “apart” from the civilization.

> I am trying to demonstrate that moral agency is not a relevant trait as why someone should be treated differently. 

But you aren’t doing a good job of it, since it’s the primary trait, and always has been. This is philosophical history you are pushing against.

> Also, not having a moral agency doesn't immediately makes you a criminal, those people can still lead normal lives.

This sentence makes no coherent sense. You aren’t understanding the basic concepts I’m using as the foundation of my argument. I’ll ask for a third time if you want to go over the debate over the basis of morality. Like I said before, that explains what I’m talking about. Since you obviously don’t understand it, I’m willing to go down that tangent.

> Insanity laws are rooted in society’s long held belief that one cannot be held responsible for a crime if they were unable to understand the implications of their actions because of a mental illness or defect. 

Yes, and what do we do when we consider somebody too insane to understand their own actions? They lose their rights and privileges. Locked up, controlled by an institution, like a prisoner. Until the time they are deemed capable of rejoining society. Until then, they have no moral rights. They have been temporarily revoked. This is a choice we currently make. Not a choice we always made in the past. Do you understand how arguing against that, doesn’t actually address my argument? 

> Why are you being intellectually lazy and taking my counter arguments literally?

I was having fun with you. The real humor, is you took my counter arguments literally in order to believe I took yours literally. I understand the point you were attempting to make, that a person could “use that as a justification”. I responded, between the lines, that historically people have been shitty. You trying to argue that a person could be a shitty person, therefore I am wrong is not a good argument. Since all I did was point out reality, and you tried to argue that since bad people existed, obviously it can’t be so. Well, it can be so, because reality isn’t a utopia. We make do with what we can do and push back against the people wanting to harm innocent lives, and arguing that bad people will do bad things if morality is what it is doesn’t address whether or not it really is what it is.

> Failed at logical consistency.

What’s a failure, is you sticking too closely to your pre-scripted vegan argument about “you gotta treat everything equal otherwise you aren’t being consistent morally.”

But if the two things aren’t equal, then treating them equal isn’t necessary. I don’t need to skip the round rock across the pond just because I skipped the flat rock across. I don’t need to rip out my gorgeous Bermuda bluegrass just because I yanked out some pesky weeds. I also don’t need to protect an animal I find tasty just because I protected a fellow human. All these things have “common traits” that you think is the primary reason to treat them commonly. But everything can have common traits if you want to find it. There is always a common denominator. The problem is you need to first explain to me why animal suffering should matter. Saying because we share the same trait does nothing. We share many traits with many things. That in itself isn’t a basis for anything. We can treat many things differently. Why? Because context matters. You keep needing to bring it back to a binary, and this is why I think your primary failing is this debate-by-numbers soundbite you have practiced about moral consistency. It’s stunted your ability to think a bit more…uniquely. More capable of original thought (that I know you have). I explained why human suffering matters, why should we care about other animals? If all you have is to point to things which contextually we want to protect for other reasons, then you’ve failed because you didn’t provide a reason to protect animals. Why do we protect children? Because they are our offspring. Duh. Why do we protect mentally disabled people? Same reason we don’t allow anybody to steal or murder. We want a society where everybody is protected equally within it, even if they encounter unfortunate things. We could all potentially be robbed, as we could all potentially have been born with disabilities. It doesn’t foster a prosperous society for a member’s life to be taken away, if they did not do harm. This is the same reason, and the general reason most people are, for a welfare system. It’s to protect the people who are unfortunate, because any one of us could have been in that position. 

But humans aren’t part of society. They don’t even understand what their responsibilities to others would be. Stick a lion in central park, and watch. Only through controlling their actions like the lower animals they are, can they be forced to conform to our moral system. But since they aren’t capable of understanding, they aren’t protected by it. There needs to be an actual argument to give them that protection, where they would be in a position to benefit from society, without needing to conform or obey the social norms/laws.


Xrystofer: 9091 : >Which group am I appealing to? 

An appeal to your own species, is a type/group. Obviously I could make a similar appeal to being black etc. An appeal to an alien species can also demonstrate that your argument is irrational and justifies the holocaust of the human race.

>The answer is the group that understand it’s actually part of a group. The ones with the cognitive ability to uphold its own moral responsibilities inside a society, in order to retain its moral rights society grants.

Different races are still human, and understand the concepts of right and wrong inside a society. Different races have moral agency, therefore your argument that races are an analog to animals is completely untenable.

You haven't demonstrated as to why I can't apply the same argument to humans, you haven't logically differentiated animals from humans in a way that justifies being treated differently.

>Sorry, but hermits and indigenous tribes aren’t allowed to murder anybody. You aren’t understanding the concept of moral agency if you believe they are not part of human society, even if they are “apart” from the civilization.

The point of this argument is to justify the murder of those who do not belong to a society.

>But you aren’t doing a good job of it, since it’s the primary trait, and always has been. This is philosophical history you are pushing against.

No, in fact you are being intellectually lazy and you are not answering my questions honestly.

>This sentence makes no coherent sense. You aren’t understanding the basic concepts I’m using as the foundation of my argument. I’ll ask for a third time if you want to go over the debate over the basis of morality. Like I said before, that explains what I’m talking about. Since you obviously don’t understand it, I’m willing to go down that tangent.

Basis of morality? Morality is subjective and exists within each person differently. The point of this discussion is to prove that there's no logical consistency to kill animals unnecessarily.

>I was having fun with you. The real humor, is you took my counter arguments literally in order to believe I took yours literally. I understand the point you were attempting to make, that a person could “use that as a justification”. I responded, between the lines, that historically people have been shitty.

We make do with what we can do and push back against the people wanting to harm innocent lives, and arguing that bad people will do bad things if morality is what it is doesn’t address whether or not it really is what it is.

Irrelevant information, GG. You do not accept the logical consistency of your own argument, let's move on.

>What’s a failure, is you sticking too closely to your pre-scripted vegan argument about “you gotta treat everything equal otherwise you aren’t being consistent morally.”

It's not a vegan argument per say, it could be used in a variety of contexts, such as abortion, the holocaust of the human race from an alien species etc.

>But if the two things aren’t equal, then treating them equal isn’t necessary.

Do you accept your own death from an alien which is vastly superior to you? You are not equal to them, therefore you cannot be treated in the same way. 

>y. I don’t need to skip the round rock across the pond just because I skipped the flat rock across. I don’t need to rip out my gorgeous Bermuda bluegrass just because I yanked out some pesky weeds. I also don’t need to protect an animal I find tasty just because I protected a fellow human.

The choice to protect someone is a personal choice. The choice to infringe on the right to life and freedom of another is not a personal choice, big difference.

>All these things have “common traits” that you think is the primary reason to treat them commonly.

I am not asking for common traits, I am asking you to name the trait that justifies the difference in the treatment of animals.

>But everything can have common traits if you want to find it. There is always a common denominator.

I am not looking for common traits, I am look for a trait or traits that justify different treatment.

What is the trait that justifies treating black humans like slaves? Obviously there isn't one.

What is the trait that justifies treating women  like slaves? Obviously there isn't one.

What is the trait that justifies treating gay like slaves? Obviously there isn't one.

>The problem is you need to first explain to me why animal suffering should matter.

If you think that human life has value, you have to logically differentiate animal life and justify why it doesn't have value.

Example: Plants are not sentient, therefore they have no value. If I wasn't sentient, I wouldn't have value either. Got it?

>Saying because we share the same trait does nothing.We share many traits with many things. That in itself isn’t a basis for anything. 

I am asking you what is the difference that justifies the difference in the treatment. You are unable to answer and you are being inconsistent.

>We can treat many things differently. 

We have to logically justify it though, or we are being inconsistent.

Rock A(2kg) and Rock B (4kg) has to be treated differently. If I was to switch the colour of those rocks, it would not justify being treated differently, the relevant trait is their weights that justifies the difference in treatment.

>Why? Because context matters. You keep needing to bring it back to a binary, and this is why I think your primary failing is this debate-by-numbers soundbite you have practiced about moral consistency.

You haven't established a difference between animals and humans that justifies their treatment yet. Your arguments justified multiple human holocausts, you are the one failing, not me.

>It’s stunted your ability to think a bit more…uniquely. More capable of original thought (that I know you have).

Do you mean that I should arbitrarily discriminate against others, like you are doing? 

> I explained why human suffering matters, why should we care about other animals?

I explained why white suffering matters, why should we care about other human races?

>If all you have is to point to things which contextually we want to protect for other reasons, then you’ve failed because you didn’t provide a reason to protect animals.

You fail to understand that since you value human life, you have to logically justify why animal life is worthless and why it is justified to be exploited for human gain.

>Why do we protect children? Because they are our offspring.

Is it okay to kill children that are not your offspring? The fact that they are offspring is not the relevant trait that justifies different treatment.

>uh. Why do we protect mentally disabled people? Same reason we don’t allow anybody to steal or murder. We want a society where everybody is protected equally within it, even if they encounter unfortunate things.

Is it okay to kill humans that are not part of a society? God dammit, do you get the fact that being a part of society is completely arbitrary and it doesn't justify different treatment? I am banging my head against the wall here. Jesus Christ.

>We could all potentially be robbed, as we could all potentially have been born with disabilities. It doesn’t foster a prosperous society for a member’s life to be taken away, if they did not do harm. This is the same reason, and the general reason most people are, for a welfare system. It’s to protect the people who are unfortunate, because any one of us could have been in that position.

What harm does a pig, chicken or a cow has ever done to you? 

>But humans aren’t part of society. They don’t even understand what their responsibilities to others would be. Stick a lion in central park, and watch. Only through controlling their actions like the lower animals they are, can they be forced to conform to our moral system. But since they aren’t capable of understanding, they aren’t protected by it. 


Is it okay to kill humans that do not have moral agency?

>There needs to be an actual argument to give them that protection, where they would be in a position to benefit from society, without needing to conform or obey the social norms/laws.

What is the trait that makes you want the right to life and freedom? It is sentience, a will to live and to be free. Those traits are also present in animals, you fail to understand that you are being inconsistent to treat them differently.


ZDTreefur: 3407 : Let me try to break down what I think the problem has been, and we can try to go piece by piece. Please don’t respond to sentences before reading all of it. I get the feeling this is part of the reason for your little problem of single sentence useless responses.

I've been saying: 

1. Humans have the ability to understand their position of moral agency, and their responsibilities within a society. Because society is the basis of morality, and the extent of it. We also have contextual reasons to not kill societal groups X(babies), Y(mentally disabled), and Z(the insane), because of the effect on society if it were to occur, we would not want to happen. We have made justifications for these caveats (even though no sane person in society needs a justification to not murder every child in society). This is called complexity, since nothing is a binary and reality gets messy with added variables and situations.

2. We are inside society, animals are outside. Things that live within society have to understand their role inside that society. This is how you obey the laws like do not murder or steal. So moral agency is a prerequisite. That’s what laws and societal values need to function. A prerequisite is the beginning, but extenuating circumstances can still grant you protection, under the right context. We decided to protect X, Y, Z, you want to also protect V(animals).

3. I do not see a valid justification for including animals into the umbrella of protection of society. I acknowledge they do not want to suffer. I acknowledge they do not want to die. I do not see that as reason enough to override our desire to raise them for slaughter, and cook for our dinner table.

You’ve been saying: 

1. Morality is subjective, not societally based. Unfortunately, this is the extent of what you’ve said there on this point. 

2. Animals don’t want to suffer, humans do not want to suffer. To give humans the treatment of protection but not animals is to treat two similar things differently. Ergo, it’s inconsistent.

3. If moral agency is the basis of our reason for protecting humans, then people can use that as a justification for doing naughty things like genocide.

I’ve responded:

1. You can see, I hope, how I can’t possibly be convinced by you simply stating it’s subjective. Without a strong enough argument, or rather, even any argument, my explanation of society being the foundation for morality must stand.

2. There are many similarities and differences you can point to when comparing literally everything. If you engage in enough reductionism, everything is connected by the similarity of atoms being what we are made of, and we all existing in the same reality. So to simply say we are treating similar things differently is not a strong enough case for an inconsistent moral worldview. You need to specify why this one particular trait ought to be the deciding factor.

3. Many bad people have done bad stuff. We haven’t been able to discover the perfect moral system yet that has no loopholes, nor have we been able to restrain unstable people from selfishly doing bad stuff to good people. But I need help in understanding how this is a valid rejection of my argument. I acknowledge bad people have used bad moral arguments as justification for doing bad stuff. How does that get us to therefore the basis of society is not moral agency?

You’ve said:

It’s your turn.


Xrystofer: 1625 : > Let me try to break down what I think the problem has been, and we can try to go piece by piece. Please don’t respond to sentences before reading all of it. I get the feeling this is part of the reason for your little problem of single sentence useless responses.

I am simply testing your justification, It's a hypocrisy test. Unless you accept the same justification used to justify your own death, then you admit to inconsistency and you are in violation of the law of non-contradiction.

You are avoiding to answer my arguments, and you simply calling them single sentences and useless doesn't dismisses them.

There's no argument that justifies killing animals, because you wouldn't accept your own death as long as you are sentient and you are not suffering. You wouldn't accept your own death if you had low intelligence, if you were not part of a society, if you weren't human, if you were tasty, if aliens produced human meat, if you were of a different species, if you didn't have a moral core, if it was legal to murder you etc. You cannot be logically consistent by arguing for an animal holocaust, unless you accept a human holocaust for the same reason.

>You need to specify why this one particular trait ought to be the deciding factor.

Because you have to justify different treatment with a trait, unless you accept that it is okay to murder you without naming a difference between you and me.

Let me present you with an example, Rock A weights 1 Kg, Rock B weights 2 Kg, everything else is exactly the same. Rock B has to be treated in a different way compared to Rock A, can you name the difference?




ZDTreefur: 649 : I thought I did a good job of summarizing my own arguments, and yours without being biased, and inviting you to add your responses to my rebuttals. Why did you not bother? What am I supposed to do with your comment right now? It's unfocused and meandering, and the questions you pose are answered in the three primary topics. 

Btw, and this is just an aside.. You've tried to use that law three times now. The law of non-contradiction doesn't mean what you think it means. If you keep trying to use it like this, somebody down the road is going to call you out, and embarrass you in front of somebody. Look it up again. Just some friendly advice.



Xrystofer: 840 : Because you simply present irrelevant information and I do not see an argument that justifies killing animals for food. If think that you made one, you should explicitly say that it justifies killing animals for food when you have other options readily available to you. Go ahead and do that, and I will address your points.

>Btw, and this is just an aside.. You've tried to use that law three times now. 

I will keep mentioning it, because you are contradicting yourself and you reject your own arguments when applied to human beings.

>The law of non-contradiction doesn't mean what you think it means. If you keep trying to use it like this, somebody down the road is going to call you out, and embarrass you in front of somebody. Look it up again. Just some friendly advice.

It's called the law of non-contradiction for a reason.





ZDTreefur: 758 : What do you mean I present "irrelevant information"? What information? I addressed the arguments you made, so it's your turn to rebut.

> If think that you made one, you should explicitly say that it justifies killing animals for food when you have other options readily available to you.

But unfortunately for you, you have the burden of proof. This is why I've simply been pointing out flaws in your arguments. I don't need to justify something I'm not convinced needs justification. You have to work hard to even demonstrate why I need to justify it, then demonstrate why it's unjustifiable.

> It's called the law of non-contradiction for a reason.

Yes, and the reason has escaped you, apparently.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction

Xrystofer: 621 : >But unfortunately for you, you have the burden of proof. This is why I've simply been pointing out flaws in your arguments. I don't need to justify something I'm not convinced needs justification. You have to work hard to even demonstrate why I need to justify it, then demonstrate why it's unjustifiable.

Is it okay to murder you? If not present me with an argument as why it is okay to murder animals when you have other options readily available for you.

>Yes, and the reason has escaped you, apparently.

It's okay to murder you then, I can arbitrarily choose if the justification is applicable or not. /Clap clap.

ZDTreefur: 637 : > Is it okay to murder you?

Come on man, all this time and you don't even understand the very *very* foundation to my position? No it's not okay to murder me, because we both live within the same society and society has rules of conduct we call ethics.

Are you even trying to understand somebody's view at this point? Because to ask that question, I can't help but get the impression have no idea at all what I believe and why. After all this, were you paying attention, or were you just waiting for your turn to talk? Discussion requires good faith on both parts, and I'm not seeing the evidence that you've held up your side of that.

Xrystofer: 63 : So, without a society and ethics, being killed is fine to you? 

ZDTreefur: 332 : Yes, without ethics, killing would not be against ethics...good job

Without society, we would all be living in the state of nature, where it's every man for himself. You could try to kill me, I could try to kill you. It's a brutal life in nature, and why we enjoy forming discrete societies that protect ourselves and our families.

Xrystofer: 280 : You are contradicting yourself, you said yes, but on the same time you are saying that you would resist my attempts. Please explain to me how it is okay if you are resisting, it doesn't make sense to me. Please stop playing game, either accept your own death or you fucking don't.

ZDTreefur: 498 : That's not a contradiction. You are not in the moral wrong to murder me, since there would not be a moral system. Jesus Christ this single sentence should not be complicated to understand.

Morally wrong is not a synonym for individually undesirable. You try to conflate the two, but very poorly. Try to kill me, and try not to die by my hand, but our actions wouldn't be a matter of morality.

*TRY* to understand. I have to ask, is English not your first language? I'm just curious at this point.

Xrystofer: 318 : You explicitly said that it is not okay to kill you because of society and ethics, when I removed those two factors you still resist the attempts in a hypothetical scenario to murder you. You cannot be okay with an action while on the same time resisting the action be done to you, it simply makes no sense whatsoever.

ZDTreefur: 382 : Yes, because of the reasons I gave. Can you actually respond to what I said? This is the millionth time you simply skipped over the actual reasoning I gave for my statement, then told me I'm being inconsistent because I have no justification for what I said.

This is why I asked if English is your primary language, but you seem to time and time again have a very poor grasp of it.

Xrystofer: 339 : I am not going to respond to what you say, because it is irrelevant. 

My question was ''if killing you is fine to you?''. You are resisting my attempts, therefore it is not fine to you since you do not accept your own murder willingly. Even without ethics and society, you still want to live regardless, and you are not fine with dying.  

ZDTreefur: 317 : ok.

I give you an answer to your question, you say "your answer is irrelevant." Obviously there is no more room for a discussion, since you simply refuse to even talk about what I tell you. 

There is obviously no value to be had in the slightest to continue to respond to you, as you simply ignore what I tell you. 

Xrystofer: 544 : How is there no room for discussion simply because I refused to answer your irrelevant question about being a native English speaker or not? You are simply trying to find an excuse, because you know that you are being irrational.

Since you seems to be biting the bullet, I am going to continue making relevant arguments.

Was slavery and Nazism "Okay", since they excluded Blacks and Jews from their society, and they had a set of ethics that made those actions morally permissible? 

Let's see if you are going to bite the bullet on this one.

ZDTreefur: 8791 : ~~An appeal to your own species, is a type/group.~~

~~Not exclusively our species, no. If you pay attention, you would notice I've been setting the bar on cognitive awareness of their role. So any species that can achieve that, can join the ranks. It's an attribute that one species so far has, but that doesn't make it appealing to just that species. See the difference?~~

~~Basis of morality? Morality is subjective and exists within each person differently.~~

~~If you want to make that argument, go for it. But a very strong case is made that morality is socially born, not individually. You seem very dismissive of any type of worldview that doesn't assume the same conclusion you reached about morality being subjective. But see, I think this is why you are struggling to understand my argument. You don't see what I'm saying as consistent, since you keep trying to look at it from a point of moral subjectivity. I don't. So what I'm saying fits within the paradigm of morality being a simple strategy a society applies its values in order to promote growth and security for members. Ergo, nothing that follows from that foundation has been inconsistent with it, since i'm not speaking from a position of believing morality to be subjectively created.~~

~~You haven't demonstrated as to why I can't apply the same argument to humans~~

~~How haven't I? Humans have the comprehension, other animals do not. If you want to treat other races differently, there is solid scientific proof that racial differences do not at all alter a person's cognitive ability to understand society, or morality. So how can I possibly not have explained that it's not applicable to humanity? Can you start actually explaining your accusations instead of just stating them?~~

~~The point of this argument is to justify the murder of those who do not belong to a society~~

~~Again, please start explaining your accusations, instead of just stating them. I gave a response, and you didn't address my response. So nothing I can go on.~~

~~Irrelevant information, GG. You do not accept the logical consistency of your own argument, let's move on.~~

~~You're making this very hard for me to want to keep responding to you, since I keep having nothing to go on, as you just ignore my responses. Again, explain, don't state.~~

~~Do you accept your own death from an alien which is vastly superior to you? You are not equal to them, therefore you cannot be treated in the same way.~~

~~How many times do I need to explain that the context matters? An argument can be made either way. You for some odd reason, don't want to admit that reality is more complex than a binary. I've answered the non sequitur alien analogy twice, now. You haven't even answered what I said, you just repeat the question.~~

~~The choice to protect someone is a personal choice. The choice to infringe on the right to life and freedom of another is not a personal choice, big difference.~~

~~What does this even mean? Seriously. You need to actually explain what point you are trying to make, not state it. Because I have laid out my argument that animals do not have rights, humans do. So what relevance is this sentence, and how does it relate to what I said?~~

~~I am not asking for common traits, I am asking you to name the trait that justifies the difference in the treatment of animals.~~

~~Which I did..so why did you respond to that sentence with this single sentence? Explain, don't state. You aren't accomplishing anything at all like this, except wasting both our times.~~

~~If you think that human life has value, you have to logically differentiate animal life and justify why it doesn't have value.~~

~~And again, I have. Can you actually address what I said, instead of oddly picking out sentences, and repeating yourself that you are asking for that? What is this accomplishing? What are you doing at this point?~~

~~You haven't established a difference between animals and humans that justifies their treatment yet. Your arguments justified multiple human holocausts, you are the one failing, not me.~~

~~Dear god... please actually respond to the reason I've been giving from the beginning. I'm starting to think you aren't even paying attention, which begs the question, why are you even responding?~~

~~Do you mean that I should arbitrarily discriminate against others, like you are doing?~~

~~Since different treatment of different things is a justifiable difference to form different treatment, I see no discrimination. So can you, I have to say this yet again, explain your points rather than just stating them?~~

~~Is it okay to kill children that are not your offspring?~~

~~We eat veal, so obviously. My answer to your question is embedded in my explanation of morality, yet you keep asking me. How about you read what I've said, or ask question to things you aren't sure of?~~

~~God dammit, do you get the fact that being a part of society is completely arbitrary and it doesn't justify different treatment?~~

~~You haven't explained in any way why society isn't the determiner of morality, as I've made an argument for. You only pointed out that bad people can do bad stuff. When I explained that's a poor response, you said "irrelevant. gg." You sound like Trump saying, "fake news" to inconvenient things. EXPLAIN why you think society is not the determiner, rather than just STATING it. Jesus Christ, this is like pulling teeth to even get anything worthwhile out of you. Single sentence responses that don't explain explain what you are trying to say doesn't accomplish anything. It's completely worthless, since there's nothing there to respond to. If you keep responding to me, I can only assume that means you *want* to respond to me. So why are you *not* responding in a meaningful way, wasting both our time?~~

~~I am banging my head against the wall here. Jesus Christ.~~

~~I understand the feeling. But since you haven't tried to actually explain your position on why I'm wrong, you have nobody to blame but yourself as to why I can't see eye to eye with you on that. I have laid out why the basis of morality is society, you have said "nu uh it's subjective" then proceeded to tell me I'm inconsistent over and over. That's not a debate. From my standpoint, I haven't been inconsistent. Everything has followed from my original foundation, and things have been explained. You need to please, please, start explaining your viewpoint instead of just making single sentence statements that don't accomplish anything.~~

~~Is it okay to kill humans that do not have moral agency?~~

~~People do champion capital punishment, so yes. Also imprisonment, which I brought up, is another form of controlling a human, and discarding their rights (or more accurately recognizing that they surrendered their own rights with their actions). So yet again, my response to a question you asked has already been said, and is embedded in my worldview. So you should have known already. Are you even bothering to pay attention? If not, why are you still responding?~~

~~What is the trait that makes you want the right to life and freedom? It is sentience, a will to live and to be free. Those traits are also present in animals, you fail to understand that you are being inconsistent to treat them differently.~~

~~You explained why they want to live. You didn't not explain we should put them in a position of having moral rights and protection, without any of the responsibilities that go with it. Just because they want to live? We want to eat them, so our desire trumps their desires unless you can exhibit an awareness of some sort of social contract with us. Otherwise we get an anti-social element. It would be like allowing wild dog packs to maraud through our streets, but feeding them and keeping them out of harm's way. If they are an element in our society we don't want, we get rid of them. Despite their desires for life, or freedom.~~

~~Those traits are also present in animals, you fail to understand that you are being inconsistent to treat them differently.~~

~~Why should we care about the trait to not want to die in other animals? Like I said, they aren't part of our society, they don't have our moral protection, and we want to eat them. So morally, they are no better than a vegetable. Also can you go one response without saying I'm "inconsistent"? I obviously don't think I am, since I think everything I have said tracks back to the basis of morality. So YOU believe I'm being inconsistent. Show, don't tell. Repeating that sentence means absolutely nothing. No, it means less than nothing since it took time out you could have used to actually explain why you think what you think.~~

If you are eating the all the animal for survival what could be wrong with that? The argument of killing is wrong can’t be used. Death is a part of life. Bears are omnivores but do you get mad at a bear for eating a deer? Maybe you don’t agree with the way animals are killed. Also referring to the “Natural” way things are a bear will smell a pregnant deer find the deer and rip the calf out the mother and eat it. Are bears wrong? No, it’s surviving. They are the apex of their environment. As for humans we have a little bit more intelligence and emotion. But we are still the apex of our environment. We kill an animal to eat to survive. If you take part in ANY of the luxuries of modern world you can’t talk about animal cruelty. The food your dogs and cats eat? Processed meat from factories Your cat and dog NEED meat. They can’t just live off of vegetables. Unfortunately people try to and because of that their pets have organ failures and die early. I understand the vegan point of view of “morality”. But morality is subjective and you can’t support your point of view fully by living in this modern world.

Why would it be a problem to reach your daily calories on a vegan diet?


>Meat, particularly poultry, has a high level of protein and fatty acids that someone like me needs to stay in top shape without being malnourished.

It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that vegetarian diets can
provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain health conditions,
including atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Well-designed
vegetarian diets that may include fortified foods or supplements meet current
nutrient recommendations and are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including
pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Vegetarians must use special
care to ensure adequate intake of vitamin B-12. Vegetarian diets are primarily plantbased,
comprised of grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and fruit; do not include
flesh foods (beef, pork, poultry and fowl, wild game, and fish); and may or may not
include some animal products, such as dairy (milk and milk products), eggs, and processed
foods that contain casein or whey. Although vegetarians may have a higher
deficiency risk for some nutrients (eg, vitamin B-12) compared to nonvegetarians,
nutritional deficiencies are not the main causes of mortality or morbidity in Western
societies. Vegetarian diets are associated with a lower risk of ischemic heart disease,
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer; low-fat vegetarian diets,
in combination with other healthy lifestyle factors, have been shown to be effective in the
treatment of these diseases. Vegetarians have lower low-density lipoprotein, better serum
glucose control, and lower oxidative stress. Low intake of foods containing saturated fat
and cholesterol, and high intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and
seeds, and soy products that are rich in fiber and phytochemicals are components of a
vegetarian diet that contribute to reduction of chronic disease.

We require very little amount of protein and it is easily achievable on a vegan diet, we also have supplements for convenience.

>and I need foods that are very nutrient-dense that don't fill me up to the point of cramping.

Animal products have 0 fiber and cause constipation, on the other hand plants are easier to digest and contribute to better bowl movements.

>Plus, humans the human tooth structure is very specific. We are clearly designed to be omnivores.

I am not going to go into whatever we are omnivorous or not. However because we are something, it doesn't mean that doing that action is right because it is natural. Are you familiar with the appeal to nature fallacy?

swimviking: 55 : umm... there actually is such a thing as animal fiber. 

Xrystofer: 185 : >umm... there actually is such a thing as animal fiber.

Thanks for pointing that out, should have been more specific.
We require dietary plant fibre in order to stimulate peristalsis. 

MasteringTheFlames: 1330 : In regards to the tooth structure comment... A lot of vegans will counter the "we have canines, therefore we're omnivores" argument by pointing out how small our canines are compared to many obligate carnivores. I don't like that argument though, as it implies that large canines correlate to a requirement for meat. Instead, I think it's worth noting that  the presence of canines means very little in regards to dietary requirements. Canine teeth are present in nearly all mammals, carnivores and herbivores alike. The hippopotamus, for example, has massive canines, some of the largest of any animal, and eats an entirely plant-based diet. Gorillas are another example of obligate herbivores with large canines, and my favorite example of this would be the saber-toothed deer!

Furthermore, the structure of our jaw heavily implies that we are herbivorous by nature. The joint where your upper and lower jawbones meet is located above the plane where your top and bottom teeth meet, which allows your lower jaw to move side to side, a requirement for grinding up plant matter with your molars. On the other hand, a carnivore's jawbones meet at the same height as their teeth. Like a pair of scissors, this is extremely effective for tearing chunks of flesh off an animal carcass, but utterly useless for chewing up plant matter

lnfinity: 80 : A cross country runner like the legendary ultramarathoner and vegan Scott Jurek?

SilentmanGaming: 308 : The tooth structure argument is so odd because I have a grandfather who hardly has any teeth and he still eats meat.

You can cook and prepare almost any dish to be edible regardless of your teeth.

Honestly I would just drop that as a reason you eat meat entirely because it doesn't seem to hold any weight.

Morangatang: 154 : Well, i mean if humans weren't meant to way meat why would we have canines and molars?  If we were designed to be herbivores we would have all flat teeth.

o_kosmos: 1632 : > If we were designed 

Your argument about teeth is strange. Either you think it's an argument in itself against veganism, or you take it to be some kind of indicator that we need meat for health. If the former, it’s simply a non-sequitur. It doesn’t follow from the fact that our teeth are shaped a certain way that we must eat a certain way. 

Besides, our canines are hardly pronounced and I could only invite you to compare our teeth to those of actual carnivores like lions, or even other omnivores like (the mostly herbivorous) gorillas and hippos. Also check out the [musk deer.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musk_deer)  It’s a saber-tooth herbivore. The point is our dentition doesn’t and shouldn’t dictate our diets – what should determine diet is what nutrients we need to survive.

So maybe you take it that the shape of our teeth is an indicator of our dietary needs? Well, you might as well just ask about health and leave our teeth out of it. Doctors and scientists working on nutrition don't look at the shape of our teeth and try to infer what we must eat. The most teeth are going to tell you is what a given organism's ancestors probably had available to them in their particular environment, but certainly it's not going to tell you which diets are optimal and which will lead to long-term health problems. Evolution is full of twists and turns, resulting in all kinds of redundancies, vestigial organs, bizarrely shaped parts, etc. So if you're worried about health our teeth don't factor in, and you can feel free to look at the vegan sidebar full of dietary experts and associations who endorse vegan diets. 

WikiTextBot: 1218 : **Musk deer**

Musk deer can refer to any one, or all seven, of the species that make up Moschus, the only extant genus of the family Moschidae. The musk deer family differs from cervids, or true deer, by lacking antlers and facial glands and by possessing only a single pair of teats, a gallbladder, a caudal gland, a pair of tusk-like teeth and—of particular economic importance to humans—a musk gland.

Musk deer live mainly in forested and alpine scrub habitats in the mountains of southern Asia, notably the Himalayas. Moschids, the proper term when referring to this type of deer rather than one/multiple species of musk deer, are entirely Asian in their present distribution, being extinct in Europe where the earliest musk deer are known to have existed from Oligocene deposits.

CubicleCunt: 244 : Compare human canines to those of cats or dogs. Our teeth are in no way suited to tear apart raw flesh. Molars are for breaking apart easily smushable plant matter. Our saliva has enzymes that break down carbs, not protein like a cat's saliva. 

swimviking: 1029 : https://imgur.com/gallery/sKR51

I think the arguments about the physical body being closer to plant-eating animals are silly. Take a look at this chart. Our back teeth may be flat for chomping insects. Our front teeth didn’t need to be like those of a wolf because we are the one animal that had hands that can not only use tools, but could break open the skull of a large herbivore to get to the brain matter— which is why we evolved to have larger brains than the rest of the carnivores. We also were much better at not only hunting in cooperation but were built for persistence hunting with our ability to sweat over our entire bodies and our build for long distance running.  
Yes we have some ability to begin digesting plant foods by saliva, and we have some (very limited in comparison) ability to ferment plant fibers, but that ability is much closer to wolves and cats than to true herbivores.  The ability to create saturated fats from plant matter is the true determinant of this and we are very weak in this regard. 

MasteringTheFlames: 882 : >We also were much better at not only hunting in cooperation but were built for persistence hunting with our ability to sweat over our entire bodies and our build for long distance running.

I unfortunately can't seem to find the paper, but I recall reading an article where this hunting technique was analyzed from a caloric perspective, and it was determined to be an incredibly inefficient method of hunting. Running a deer to exhaustion would require a chase of at least 25 miles, possibly as much as 50. Running a minimum of almost a marathon for one deer, plus carrying its carcass the 25-50 miles back to the hunter's village would likely result in a net loss of calories! While there is historical evidence implying that exhaustion hunting was sometimes accomplished, it was basically just a way for the most elite athletes to show off. It was not a common hunting technique

swimviking: 388 : yeah. I probably wouldn’t choose to follow a deer if I were hunting this way, but I can think of a heck of a lot of animals that run less efficiently than a deer!  Nothing runs like a deer! A deer would take team work and projectiles. Yes simply running a deer until it breaks — that would be showing off. Most other animals though, running and team work would have been a strong factor. 

Copacetic_Curse: 941 : According to that chart it's impossible for humans to survive [without animal protein](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/dieteticorgs) and apparently humans don't have a[ rotary pattern of jaw movement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2745715/). It's also very convenient to use a ruminant as an example of a herbivore since they get to point out they don't have things like canines. I wonder why they didn't use a horse or a gorilla or a hippo instead? I guess it would have looked awfully silly if they showed how humans and elephants have the same ratio of digestive tract length to body length.

Regardless, humans do quite well on a plant based diet. So much so that it has been shown to reverse some of our [worst diseases](http://dresselstyn.com/JFP_06307_Article1.pdf). There isn't any practical reason to worry about any of this as we already know how well people can function when eating primarily whole plant foods.

swimviking: 2323 : Also, whether humans do well on on a vegetarian diet is arguable.  I have a hard time with people saying that mostly because most studies that say this really only compare against the biggest loser of all: the standard American diet. (a diet of skittles could probably beat the crap most people eat if the study was short enough.) There is quite a bit of science out there saying the opposite. For instance, we have read on cereal boxes for years that science says fiber is good in the fight against heart disease. That claim is based on one thing, and that is the fact that fiber can reduce cholesterol.  There are a few problems with that:  1) the reason it lowers cholesterol is that it blocks the reabsorption of bile, and thus more cholesterol is used to make more bile... that’s it. No heart healthy magic there. We poop out more cholesterol when we eat bran flakes and have to make more. 2) more and more science is emerging that high cholesterol is not the issue in heart disease.  Oxidation of cholesterol is a much bigger factor, along with high triglycerides.  The biggest culprit in ox-ldl seems be vegetable oils, and the culprit in triglycerides is carbohydrate. The trig/HDL ratio is proving to be a much more accurate indicator of heart disease, and what raises HDL?— saturated animal fats appear to be protective in that regard. 3) the science on vegetarianism and healthy aging is bleak. Things like sarcopenia, diverticulitis, arthritis, Alzheimer’s and more are proving to be more prevalent and that terrifies me.  There are also just so many N=1’s out there, just like in the vegetarian world I am sure, where people get healthy and fight off or reduce the symptoms of chronic diseases when they go from plant-based to animal based diets. The N=1 stories I read about with vegetarians usually come from a standard diet, while many meat-eaters come from veganism because they were trying to be healthy and eventually got sicker. 

Are there any studies out there that compare full veganism vs full high fat carnivory? Are there N=1 stories out there of full carnivores going vegan because they had chronic diseases while carnivorous?  If there are, please point them out to me. I can be swayed by anything that is good science and I truly would drop meat eating if I thought it were best for my health. 

Copacetic_Curse: 2680 : There are studies that place vegan diets against omnivorous ones, but they seem pretty rare. It usually isn't so profound that we can claim that veganism is the healthiest way to live for everyone, but there are usually advantages. [This study](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/8/1777.short), for example, placed patients on a 22 week vegan diet and a diet following the American Diabetes Association guidelines and found 43% of the vegan group and 26% of the ADA group participants reduced diabetes medications.

I'm not sure where where you are getting your information on saturated fats. Most authoritative bodies recommend limiting saturated fat intake at 10% or less of total amount calories with several recommending as little as possible ([source](http://sci-hub.io/10.1017/S0007114512001444), page S12).

[The American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/The-American-Heart-Associations-Diet-and-Lifestyle-Recommendations_UCM_305855_Article.jsp) recommends reducing saturated fat to no more than 5 to 6 percent of total calories (about 13 grams a day for 2k calories a day -about 2 tbsp of butter a day) if you want to lower blood cholesterol.

I'm not sure if you read the links in my last posts. [This study](http://dresselstyn.com/JFP_06307_Article1.pdf) had 93% of people that adhered to the diet see improvements in symptoms with 22% showing an actual reversal of the leading killer of Americans, heart disease. The authors do point out that these people were self-selected, very determined patients, not randomly selected ones. Still it shows that it is possible. And there's more [like thi](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/544S.full)s to back it up.

The [other link](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/dieteticorgs) was to a list of major dietetic organizations and their position on vegan diets. There is no real debate, a well planned vegan diet is healthy at every stage of life.

And while it may not be an example of strict veganism, you may be interested in checking out [blue zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Zone), areas that have the world's longest-lived people. While there are a lot of factors that they all share that could contribute to their long life span, they all eat a largely plant based diet with, typically, a lot of legumes.

I'm not going to say you can't be healthy and eat meat, but if you could be just as healthy eating plants it would be good to make the switch for other reasons as well. [The environmental impact of animal agriculture is tremendous](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM) and there is also the ethical considerations as well.

WikiTextBot: 1109 : **Blue Zone**

Blue Zones is an anthropological concept that describes the characteristic lifestyles and the environments of the world's longest-lived people. The term first appeared as an international concept in the November 2005 National Geographic Magazine cover story "The Secrets of a Long Life" by Dan Buettner. Buettner identified five geographic areas where people live statistically longest: Okinawa (Japan); Sardinia (Italy); Nicoya (Costa Rica); Icaria (Greece) and among the Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California. He offers an explanation, based on empirical data and first hand observations, as to why these populations live healthier and longer lives.

SilentmanGaming: 716 : Well our canines are pretty puny compared to actual carnivores. I think human's teeth are pretty bad at the whole ripping and tearing deal, but we are good at chewing. So that's why I said it's reasonable to think we are closer to herbivore than carnivore.

If you had modern technology taken away from you it would be pretty hard to be mostly carnivorous even if you didn't need to hunt you just found dead animals. Conversely it'd be a walk in the park to be herbivorous.

It's important to note that I'm not actually arguing that we ARE herbivorous or we ARENT carnivorous or omnivorous. I'm simply saying if you compare us to other herbivores and other carnivorous we would more easily fit in with the herbivores

fatdog1111: 1372 : Also please check out ultra athlete Rich Roll's [book Finding Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Ultra-Rejecting-Becoming-Discovering/dp/0307952207). He also has a podcast.

Also, please know your friend must have been doing something wrong. The [world's largest body of nutrition professionals says](http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/practice/position-and-practice-papers/position-papers/vegetarian-diets):

"It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood and for ATHLETES [my emphasis]."

We may be designed to be omnivores, but that implies choice, right? And why choose to kill anything if we don't have to? The physician head of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine at Yale recently published a newsletter entitled, "The Case for Veganism" [here](http://www.davidkatzmd.com/articles.aspx). 

I appreciate that you're not vegan because you think you need animal products and not that you don't care about animals and the environment. I hope you find some of these sources informative. Thanks for being open minded!

alaa_raslan: 40 : because it's nature, animals eat animals

1r15: 87 : Animals kill animals. Animals rape animals. So when an animal does something it is ok? 

alaa_raslan: 661 : that's were being humans come in , we have conscious we know what's wrong and right while eating is necessary for life, I've never been in a debate about this topic because clearly we have different believes, it looks like you vegans value animals life so much you put them at the same levels of humans, for me all i see is living beings just eat and sleep and have sex there is no purpose for them, and i really respect your believe and i never tried to have argument with one of you, but my question is what's the difference between animals and plants being both living creatures. why u decide that animals deserve to live and plants not, i am really carious.

1r15: 503 : Hey we're not having an argument, we're having a discussion were we both could learn something. Of course there are many differences between animals and humans. I don't value an animals life over a humans life but I do value an animals life over a 15 minute meal. We know animals are capable of feeling pain. They have a brain and pain sensors. Plants do not have this. Eating meat , dairy or eggs is unnecessary for your health. Why would you decide to harm a sentient being if you can choose not to?

Akyrael: 192 : Because we're omnivores, I like the taste of meat, and we live in a relatively free country. Having said that, I've cut my meat consumption quite a bit due to health and environmental reasons.

YaCy14zrzZKJmpt4dYyD: 716 : I went vegan for purely health reasons, and part of this particular program is to view meat, dairy and processed foods as dangerous because it is addictive, calorie dense and for the most part has excessive saturated fat.  I haven't had luck with moderation.  This philosophy has been successful, and is not one to make me suffer. I am satisfied with all the bread, pasta, rice, beans and potatoes I can eat: no calorie restrictions.  It takes more to cook the healthy foods. Just another philosophy and so far, so good.   For people who follow the moderation philosophy well, I think they can get as healthy as a vegan (whole food-plant based), but on average, that has not been shown in many studies.

Best wishes.

Akyrael: 382 : Thank you for your well thought out response. I personally don't care what people have as their personal preferences. Let's just not hate on one another for it.

I generally stick to chicken, and home made food, so lower concern for calories from that. It's the beer that gives me the extra ten pounds, and I know because I cut out alcohol for a few months to see what would happen.

Xrystofer: 890 : >Because we're omnivores,

I also like money and sex, I do not go out and commit acts of rape and robbery though.

>and we live in a relatively free country.

We live in countries that oppress the rights of other individuals based on the arbitrary trait of species, I wouldn't claim that we are a free country when we have animal slavery and an animal holocaust taking place to satisfy our taste buds.

>Having said that, I've cut my meat consumption quite a bit due to health and environmental reasons.

Since you realise that we are killing them needlessly (we do not need them to survive), there's no need to further contribute to their suffering, exploitation and death. Don't you think that a rational person should come to this conclusion of their own free will?

YaCy14zrzZKJmpt4dYyD: 1525 : A vegan diet has to be well planned for proper nutrition, from what I have read.  I initially spent a lot of time making sure I get certain nutrients, such as calcium, and b12 with a supplement.  On the whole, I am eating way healthier now, though, consistently.   I get A/C/K vitamins far more consistently now since I track daily in cronometer.com . My system is now down pat, and I no longer have to worry as long as I stick to the routine.  

The foods I buy are pretty simple ones.  Many people might be shocked at the level of simplicity and think it would be intolerable, but it is fully satisfying.  I'll eat homemade whole wheat bread for a meal, baked potato slices with salt for another meal, or whole wheat pasta with no sauce but with salt for yet another meal.  I'll also eat chia seeds, a small amount of almonds, blackstrap molasses for a little extra calcium, and a handful of other things, but my meals are usually a single food item. 

A 10 pound bag of Russett potatoes makes the cost drop a lot, and I eat like 20 ounces of potatoes in a single meal (3 potatoes).


Whole wheat bread cost for 1300 calories: $.76 for ingredients.  (very tasty to me)

Baked potato slices, 40 ounces, 873 calories:  $.89

Brown Rice/Pinto Beans/Fresh Spinach: $1.09 ingredient cost for 639 calories (this includes Picante sauce for flavor)

I mix up these foods in different combinations to get calories around 2100 daily.   My average food cost is probably $3-$4, daily, but it takes work to prepare: not a lot, but some.

Xrystofer: 3949 : >It's more expensive and more difficult to eat a healthy vegan diet than it is to eat a mix of different foods. Perhaps I'm ignorant, and it's much more simple to do than I expect. People where I live are taught how to eat healthy in a non-vegan way, and "vegan" foods are far more expensive.

Whole foods are usually dirty cheap and being healthy isn't necessarily expensive. The most expensive foods are usually the ones that have been processed.

ABSTRACT
It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that vegetarian diets can
provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain health conditions,
including atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Well-designed
vegetarian diets that may include fortified foods or supplements meet current
nutrient recommendations and are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including
pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Vegetarians must use special
care to ensure adequate intake of vitamin B-12. Vegetarian diets are primarily plantbased,
comprised of grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and fruit; do not include
flesh foods (beef, pork, poultry and fowl, wild game, and fish); and may or may not
include some animal products, such as dairy (milk and milk products), eggs, and processed
foods that contain casein or whey. Although vegetarians may have a higher
deficiency risk for some nutrients (eg, vitamin B-12) compared to nonvegetarians,
nutritional deficiencies are not the main causes of mortality or morbidity in Western
societies. Vegetarian diets are associated with a lower risk of ischemic heart disease,
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer; low-fat vegetarian diets,
in combination with other healthy lifestyle factors, have been shown to be effective in the
treatment of these diseases. Vegetarians have lower low-density lipoprotein, better serum
glucose control, and lower oxidative stress. Low intake of foods containing saturated fat
and cholesterol, and high intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and
seeds, and soy products that are rich in fiber and phytochemicals are components of a
vegetarian diet that contribute to reduction of chronic disease.

Well if an Omnivorous diet is unhealthy, that in it's self is a personal choice to harm yourself and therefore it doesn't constitute an argument. The problem is that buying animal products harms others, but there's no need to talk about that now.

There are marked differences between us and plant-eaters, and our body measurements conform to Kleibers law when all of these aspects are considered, but only with a very nutrient dense diet of mainly animal foods.

Also, I tried going vegan for a week and it was the worst experience of my life. So much stuff has animal products. Like, the last straw was no eggs/dairy products. Maybe I will try it at a different time in my life.

R2-666: 2620 : Thank you for replying!

>it tastes good.

But you like the taste of meat only after it's been cooked and seasoned, no?

That would mean you like the taste of the seasoning not the taste of meat. Or do you also enjoy the taste of an uncooked and unseasoned meat straight from a fresh corpse of a cow or a pig? I personally never did.

>I tried going vegan for a week and it was the worst experience of my life. So much stuff has animal products.

Interesting! For me going vegan was the best experience of my life in terms of food.

I had never experienced so many delicious and different tastes before.
I used to eat meat every day (steak was my favorite) but the taste and the texture of meat was becoming repetitive for me.

There is a stereotype that vegan food is boring salads or tasteless recipes when in reality for me it's been delicious vegan pizzas, vegan sushi, burgers, pastas, Indian foods/curries, chinese food, hot dogs, frankfurter pies, soups, lentil foods, french fries, potato chips, buckwheat porridge, vanilla banana oatmeal, cereal, ice creams, vanilla and chocolate pudding and so much more!

Now you might be thinking "Yeah, but vegan pizza, vegan sushi and vegan cheese is not as tasty as the real thing." - that was my thinking too before I actually tried them.

My reaction to eating a vegan hot dog for the first time was, "Wow, I can't use meat tastes good as an argument anymore, because this tastes exactly the same."

>the last straw was no eggs/dairy products.

As someone who has lactose intolerance, going vegan was a real blessing because I found so many alternatives to cow milk. Like soy milk, coconut milk, almond milk, oat milk and rice milk. I was finally able to eat cereal again. They even make vanilla and chocolate soy milks, puddings, chocolate bars and ice creams.

My favorite milks are made by the company Alpro (haven't tried other companies). Google what their products look like, maybe you can find them at your store if you want to try them. I recommend my personal favorites - coconut milk and soy milk. I don't like almond milk.

If you decide to give it another shot then I recommend doing it slowly step by step. For example, stop eating meat but keep eggs and dairy. Later stop consuming dairy but keep the eggs, and so on and on.

I was afraid that going vegan is going to be very hard, tasteless and limiting. To my surprise it was actually one of the easiest changes in my life. Going to bed early is 1000x times harder for me :D

If you have any questions feel free to ask me or head to /r/vegan - they're really friendly but I never post there personally.

I'm curious about the point you are trying to make with this?  I don't like many vegetables unless they are cooked/seasoned, does that mean that my liking them isn't valid?

As a followup point, there are a few raw meat dishes, Sashimi and beef tartare are two examples.

R2-666: 2503 : The person I was replying to said that part of his/her main argument against going vegan is that **meat** tastes good.

If you only like the taste of meat after it's been cooked and seasoned, that would mean you like the taste of seasoning, not the meat + most seasoning is done with herbs, spices and sea salt, which are **vegan**. (from Wikiepdia: Seasoning is the process of adding salt, herbs, or spices to food to enhance the flavor.)

If you like the taste of seasoning, and not the meat, then why not season meat substitutes exactly the same way and achieve the same taste without taking a sentient being's life, without contributing to a massive waste of resources (1 pound of beef = 2,500 gallons of water. Deforestation - animal agriculture is responsible for up to 80%-91% of Amazon destruction), without contributing to climate change (animal agriculture accounts for more CO2 per year than all transportation methods combined. And there's methane and nitrous oxide, too)

>I'm curious about the point you are trying to make with this?

The point I'm making is that if you realize you like the taste of seasoning not the meat, then where is the logic in choosing the catastrophically wasteful, unsustainable and cruel way, over the other way when the taste is exactly the **same**.

I've eaten chicken substitutes that taste exactly the same, the texture is exactly the same.

I've eaten soy wieners and sausages that have exactly the same taste, texture and even the same chewiness as animal product wieners.

>I don't like many vegetables unless they are cooked/seasoned, does that mean that my liking them isn't valid?

No, because that is not self-contradictory. 

Vegetables are vegan and seasoning is vegan.
If you like them after they've been seasoned, you are still liking the taste of something that is plant-based.

But when someone says they like the taste of meat but the taste comes from seasoning which is plant-based, then that is self-contradictory.
Saying you like meat when the taste is achieved only thanks to plant-based seasoning, does not mean you like the taste of meat. 

Unless you are specifically talking about raw meat dishes like Sashimi or beef tartare. The latter is often seasoned, by the way.

Raw meat dishes is the reason I asked the person the question if they like meat only after it's been cooked and seasoned.

He/she has not yet answered, but do you really think he/she eats raw meat dishes everyday, as opposed to cooked and seasoned chicken or pork?

someguy_2322123: 2057 : > If you only like the taste of meat after it's been cooked and seasoned, that would mean you like the taste of seasoning, not the meat + most seasoning is done with herbs, spices and sea salt, which are vegan.

But meat does have a flavor, if I cook a piece of steak and a piece of tofu the same way, they will taste completely different.  And from your wikipedia quote, the key word is enhance, the seasonings by themselves aren't going to taste as good without the base meat flavors

>The point I'm making is that if you realize you like the taste of seasoning not the meat, then where is the logic in choosing the catastrophically wasteful, unsustainable and cruel way, over the other way when the taste is exactly the same.

I can't speak for op, but I can say that I do the taste of meat, it isn't just a seasoning delivery mechanism.

>I've eaten chicken substitutes that taste exactly the same, the texture is exactly the same.
>I've eaten soy wieners and sausages that have exactly the same taste, texture and even the same chewiness as animal product wieners.

That comes down to personal preference, I have never cared for the substitutes that I have tried.

>But when someone says they like the taste of meat but the taste comes from seasoning

Again I disagree with you.  Meat has a favor that is enjoyable for some people.

>Unless you are specifically talking about raw meat dishes like Sashimi or beef tartare. The latter is often seasoned, by the way.

Yes it is seasoned, but whenever I have made it was just a little bit of salt, trying to then argue that all of the flavor in that dish is from the salt is a large stretch.

>He/she has not yet answered, but do you really think he/she eats raw meat dishes everyday, as opposed to cooked and seasoned chicken or pork?

I'm still not sure about the cooking thing.  If I were to enjoy non-seasoned cooked chicken, what difference would that make?  I still enjoy the meat just cooked.

R2-666: 3025 : Thank you for replying.

> if I cook a piece of steak and a piece of tofu the same way, they will taste completely different.

Tofu is not a substitute for steak, and tofu on it's own is already differently seasoned prior to you trying to season it like steak, so of course it's gonna taste differently. I was talking about chicken and wieners/frankfurters which have been replicated to complete accuracy.

> And from your wikipedia quote, the key word is enhance.

You are right. The word is enhance, but we can just play with words here as I can find other definitions of seasoning like
>macmillandictionary - seasoning - salt, pepper, or other spices that you add to food to **improve** the taste

>Cambridge dictionary - seasoning - a substance, especially salt or pepper, that is added to food to **improve** its flavour

Definitions of **improve**  vary from:

>to make something better

> To raise to a more desirable or more excellent quality or condition; make better

For the sake of accuracy, I wouldn't use the word enhance, as it implies it magnifies something that is already there, but seasoning gives a completely different taste.

I'll add my own anecdotal evidence.

To me, non-seasoned meat (especially chicken) was always terrible and boring in terms of taste, while the taste of seasoned meat was always enjoyable and completely different from non-seasoned.

You replied to my
>where is the logic in choosing the catastrophically wasteful, unsustainable and cruel way, over the other way when the taste is exactly the same.

with 
> I can't speak for op, but I can say that I do the taste of meat, it isn't just a seasoning delivery mechanism.

1) It is just the seasoning for **a lot** of meats like the ones I keep mentioning (chicken, wieners), but I agree, it's not just the seasoning for every single meat.

2) Is the taste worth the price you pay? Animal agriculture is unsustainable. Oceans could be empty by 2048. Animal agriculture is more contributing to climate change than all transportation combined, and climate change will be the end of us, unless stopped.
 
Eating meat will **guarantee** you heart disease - the number 1 killer in US, unless of course you die of something else before.

And needless to say, eating meat kills a sentient being's life.

Is a **specific** taste worth all of that? 

Some common replies are:

1) Climate change is not real.

2) I don't care about animals.

3) I love animals but I need meat to survive

3) Heart disease? Well, we all die anyway! Everything kills us!

> **If** I were to enjoy non-seasoned cooked chicken, what difference would that make? I still enjoy the meat just cooked.

Your argument/reply comes down to a big **if**?


It could be a fun debating point, but for the sake of progression lets take into equation the dominating reality and leave the if's or the minority out.

Most people who eat meat, eat significantly seasoned meat.

And once again, if you enjoy non-seasoned meat, is it still enough to justify the unsustainable cost?

someguy_2322123: 3697 : This has been an interesting discussion

>Tofu is not a substitute for steak, and tofu on it's own is already differently seasoned prior to you trying to season it like steak, so of course it's gonna taste differently.

Which is why I was using it as an example to show that seasons/cooking aren't the whole.

>I was talking about chicken and wieners/frankfurters which have been replicated to complete accuracy.

That is again up to personal preference.

>You replied to my

Actually I wasn't replying to it because the moral/environmental discussion wasn't interesting.

>2) Is the taste worth the price you pay? Animal agriculture is unsustainable. Oceans could be empty by 2048. Animal agriculture is more contributing to climate change than all transportation combined, and climate change will be the end of us, unless stopped.

I think that this is where the discussion breaks down, because I either don't agree with or don't care about most of the reasons to go vegan.

>Animal agriculture is unsustainable.

Unsustainable in what way?  Maybe not in its current form, but the industry will continue to evolve.

>Oceans could be empty by 2048

I honestly don't know a lot about this, but this is probably fixable.

>Animal agriculture is more contributing to climate change than all transportation combined, and climate change will be the end of us, unless stopped.

There are changes that need to be made, but no meat isn't the only answer.


>Eating meat will guarantee you heart disease - the number 1 killer in US, unless of course you die of something else before.
>3) Heart disease? Well, we all die anyway! Everything kills us!

Pretty much.  Also a person can have some self control, we aren't all just going to mcdonalds 3 times a day.

>And needless to say, eating meat kills a sentient being's life.
2) I don't care about animals.

This point doesn't matter to me, I lived on a dairy farm that also raised beef cows for a few years, I didn't primary work on the farm, but helped out some.  I personally though that the cows had a relatively good cow life.  They were able to roam around the pastures, when their time came, they were slaughtered quickly and I doubt they suffered.  Obviously others will disagree with me, but the other point I think of is that if not for their purpose, those cows wouldn't have excised, so it isn't like they would have otherwise lived out their happy wild cow lives, beef was their only option.  I don't know what difference it would make in anything had the cows never existed or lived to become beef.

>Is a specific taste worth all of that?

My opinion is yes.  Most of the sustainable issues can be fixed by either new technology, or reduction.  

>Your argument/reply comes down to a big if?

I was trying to figure out why you kept referencing cooking.


If I understand your argument, if basically is that for most prepared things, there are substitutes that are as good or better, so why not switch?

I think the answer for some situations comes down to one of three possibilities
1. Every time I have looked at those substitute products, they are always more expensive than the meat product, so cost is a valid reason.
2. The taste/consistency isn't desirable for some people
3. Some people don't like the thought of vegan things

If you are curious, My specific reasons are #1 and 2.  I don't eat the substitutes because in my experience they aren't as good and they are more expensive.  I don't have any moral concerns that make the cost/sacrifice worth it to me, so i don't eat it.



R2-666: 6450 : I said

> Chicken and wieners/frankfurters which have been replicated to complete accuracy.

You said

>That is again up to personal preference.

I believe it is more likely that it's down to personal experience rather than preference. The supermarkets around me probably have a largely different selection than the supermarkets around you.

To climate change you replied

>There are changes that need to be made, but no meat isn't the only answer.

Not eating meat is one of the most efficient way if not the most efficient way to stop contributing to climate change.

1) Animal agriculture accounts for more CO2 per year than all transportation methods combined.

2) In terms of total annual global GHG emissions, animal agriculture accounts for 51%, while all combined transportation accounts for 13%.

3) If we would all stop using gas, oil, fuel, electricity, etc forever, we would still exceed our carbon equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of 565 gigatons by the year 2030 just with the impact of livestock alone.

4) Livestock is responsible for 65% of all emissions of nitrous oxide - a greenhouse gas 296 times more destructive than carbon dioxide and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years.

5) Not to do with climate change, but 1 year as a vegan would save 724,925 gallons of water - you would have to not shower for 66 years to save that amount of water if you take 15 minute showers, 100 years if you take 10 minute showers.
In US alone, animal agriculture uses from 34-76 **trillion** gallons annually.

> a person can have some self control, we aren't all just going to mcdonalds 3 times a day.

You don't have to go to McDonald's, and meat once a day is enough for eventual heart disease.

And heart disease isn't the only thing related to meat, but also lung diseases, brain diseases, digestive cancers, infections, diabetes, high blood pressure, liver diseases, blood cancers, kidney disease, breast cancer, suicidal depression and prostate cancer, to name a few.



> Me:Oceans could be empty by 2048

>You: I honestly don't know a lot about this, but this is probably fixable.

Well, how?
3/4 of the world's fisheries are exploited. 90 million tons of fish are pulled from our oceans each year.
For every 1 pound of fish caught, up to 5 pounds of unintended marine species are caught and discarded as by-kill.

Animal agriculture is the leading cause of ocean dead zones with livestock operations on land having created more than 500 nitrogen-flooded dead zones around the world in our oceans.

>I personally though that the cows had a relatively good cow life. They were able to roam around the pastures, when their time came, they were slaughtered quickly and I doubt they suffered. 

Dairy cows are exploited their entire lives.

Cows only produce milk when they're pregnant or have a newborn to feed. So the dairy industry inseminates/impregnates cows starting at the age of around 12 months again and again and again till they collapse after 4 or 5 years (cows **natural** life span is 20 years!).

Cows are impregnated by inserting a long tube into the vagina of a female cow, usually while she's confined in what the industry literally calls a **rape** rack. And sometimes they put a fist into the anus of the female cow to loosen the area, to which cows react uneasily.

When a baby cow is born, it's taken almost immediately away from its mother and locked in a crate, because if it stayed around it would drink the milk.

A mother cow's bond with her young is very strong that she tries to chase after the babies and sometimes cries out for **days** in search of her baby.

If the baby is a male, his throat is slit and he's sold for veal.

If it's a girl, they are raised to a life where they are continuously kept pregnant their whole lives to keep them lactating.
This leads to premature aging, exhaustion, and mastitis, a **painful** common condition in dairy cows, which is inflammation and sometimes infection of the udder.

When a dairy cow is finally physically and emotionally too exhausted to continue on, she collapses.
These cows are called 'downers' and they're dragged out by whatever means (tractor, chains, rope) to be killed and sold for beef.

Peak milk production declines around four to five years anyways, so if the dairy cows are still standing, they're gonna be killed for beef regardless. Doesn't sound like a happy life at all and I personally would never argue that a life of suffering and torture from start to finish, is better than not existing at all.

>Most of the sustainable issues can be fixed by either new technology, or reduction. 

As you can see from the numbers I brought up, this simply is not true. We are gonna run out of fish, we are gonna run out of forests. 

We are also running out of time with climate change, and collapsing the animal agriculture is by far the most efficient way to stop it.

The only technology that could fix it would be lab grown meat.

>I was trying to figure out why you kept referencing cooking.

I keep referencing to cooking because if we are true omnivores, why are we disgusted by a fresh corpse of an animal instead of getting an instinct to eat it?
We cook it, season it, till it reminds us nothing of a corpse and then we find it appealing.

Yes, yes, a few raw meat dishes, but that doesn't account for the majority of the diet for the majority of the people.

> Every time I have looked at those substitute products, they are always more expensive than the meat product

I'm sorry to 'hear' this, if it's fully accurate. For me being vegan has been much much cheaper as the substitute products I've been buying are cheaper than meat. 

I buy from supermarkets/normal stores, and I avoid organic stores, bio stores or whatever they are called, because I find their products to be overpriced.

>Some people don't like the thought of vegan things

That's the fault of what they perceive as vegan things. 

Personally I'm eating burgers, pizza, sushi, soups, pastas, Indian food, vegetable dishes, sausages, salads, french fries, ice-cream, pudding, oatmeal, just to name a few.

>I don't have any moral concerns that make the cost/sacrifice worth it to me, so i don't eat it.

For you it comes down to taste vs taste and you don't care about the environment, health, farm animals, the fish and animals affected by deforestation?
Is this true? Don't take this is as an attack, I just wish to be sure if I'm understanding you correctly.

ConnerKid: 185 : I'm sorry to bring up a dead and gone argument but you make a lot of claims without sources and your idea that seasoning is completely what gives anything flavor is blatantly incorrect.

R2-666: 732 : 1) Write me a list of claims you'd like sources to, and I'll give you.

2) I didn't say "seasoning is **completely** what gives anything flavor".
I'm saying that the argument most meat eaters make is flawed - "Meat tastes good". 

It's flawed because when they say meat tastes good, it's not even the taste of the actual meat they are describing. It's been cooked and seasoned with vegan things. If they'd eat the same meat, straight from a corpse, uncooked and unseasoned, then I highly doubt they would like the taste.

It's also a flawed argument because the taste of 'meat' has already been achieved with vegan foods. The vegan chicken, sausages, hot dogs and burgers that I've eaten and continue to eat, taste exactly the same.

ConnerKid: 119 : I like the taste of a plain grilled steak that had been lightly salted. How can you say I don't like the taste of meat?

R2-666: 354 : But you just wrote yourself that it is grilled and lightly salted. Grilling alters the taste, so does salt.

If you eat that same meat straight from a corpse, not grilled, not salted, do you really think you would like the real taste of meat? Assuming, of course, that you'd be able to even eat a corpse without starting to feel sick from the idea alone.

ConnerKid: 511 : That is just nonsense. I'm sorry.

Cooking food does not change what it is composed of. I love bread too, doesn't mean I'm gonna go eat some flour or wheat stalks.

Just because I grill my steak and salt it doesn't mean I'm 'masking the flavor.' It just means I cooked the meat so it is safe to consume. 

And no one likes the taste of salt, if you knew anything about cooking you would know salt is used to make something taste more like itself. You never season something with salt to make it taste like salt.

R2-666: 2243 : Why do you keep creating straw man arguments and putting words to my mouth?

Never did I write that cooking food changes the composition of meat. Please quote the part where you claim that I said it.

The 2nd straw man you created was, "seasoning is completely what gives anything flavor". Never did I say that either.

We are talking about the taste of meat, not the composition.

Look at title of the thread
 > "What is your main argument against going vegan?".

 And the argument we are talking about is that "Meat **TASTES** good", not, "I like the composition of meat".

If you don't like the taste of meat straight from a corpse, uncooked and unseasoned, but you like it **only after** it's been cooked and seasoned, then you do not like the real taste of meat. The taste you claim to like, at that point, is not the real taste of meat anymore. This is so simple.

> I love bread too, doesn't mean I'm gonna go eat some flour or wheat stalks.

But there you say that you love bread. You are not saying that you love flour or wheat stalks.

You love it only **after** it's been altered from flour or wheat.
It's the same thing with meat. You love it only **after** it's been cooked and seasoned.

Do you seriously think that grilling does not change the taste of meat?

>And no one likes the taste of salt

I do. So that claim is already not true.

> If you knew anything about cooking you would know salt is used to make something taste more like itself.

I cook every day. After adding salt, the taste is completely different. It is not just a magnified version of the food I'm eating.

But for argument's sake, lets pretend that salt only makes something taste more like itself.
When you add salt, in that case you are making it taste more like **grilled** meat - which already has a very different taste from a corpse.

>You never season something with salt to make it taste like salt.

I never said that either.

Anyhow, "I like the taste of meat", is one of the weakest arguments against plant-based diets. Because the same taste is easily achieved without meat, and liking the taste of meat is no justification for the unsustainable waste of resources and for the apathetic killing of over 50 **b**illion sentient beings each year.

ConnerKid: 1100 : Girl, come on. Grilling meat doesn't mean I don't like the taste of meat. 

You have this notion that if I wouldn't go up to a cow and eat it raw that I don't actually like the taste of meat. I don't see how you're making this leap in logic. I like it prepared a certain way, that doesn't mean my liking of it is invalidated. 

Cooked meat has a flavor and texture that has not been replicated with vegan substitutes. And you cannot argue that with me since you can't compare them if you don't eat meat. 

Plenty of people are fine with vegan substitutes. And I enjoy a lot of vegan food as well but nothing vegan has replicated the taste, texture, or richness of a medium rare steak to me. And it I don't really like meat as you claim then wouldn't I be satisfied with a vegan substitute?

You can argue that simply liking it is not enough of a justification, and that's totally valid and I would concede that to you. But when you come up with nonsense arguments like the ones you're spouting right now you completely undermine veganism and help perpetuate the stereotype that vegans are delusional.

R2-666: 1889 : I don't know why you are calling me one, but fyi I'm not a girl lmao.

> Grilling meat doesn't mean I don't like the taste of meat. 

It means that you like GRILLED meat.
If you go eat a raw corpse and you don't like it, then how can you claim that you like it? And you're implying that I'm the one who is delusional? lol.

The only reason it is difficult for you to understand is because you emotionally identify with meat and you are experiencing cognitive dissonance to the point where you are too afraid to even admit that you only like cooked meat.

> Cooked meat has a flavor and texture that has not been replicated with vegan substitutes. And you cannot argue that with me since you can't compare them if you don't eat meat. 

You are wrong. I can argue with you because I ate meat for 20 years. Vegan chicken has the exact same taste AND texture as real cooked chicken meat.
The same thing with sausages and wieners.
**100%** the same taste and texture! They've been replicated so perfectly that you cannot even tell the difference. 

Obviously there are bad products out there. Ditch the ones you've already tried and try other products. Every real meat doesn't always taste great either. Do you generalize then too? No.

> You come up with nonsense arguments.

Are you sure that those "nonsense arguments" aren't the straw man arguments that you made up yourself and then pretended that I said them?

I'm still waiting for you to quote me on where I said that cooking meat changes composition, and that seasoning is completely what gives anything flavor.

You argue with yourself on multiple occasions and then imply that I am delusional. Ironic.

You said "you make a lot of claims without sources".
I'm still waiting for that list of claims.

> perpetuate the stereotype that vegans are delusional.

Says the person perpetuating the stereotype that meat eaters are delusional.

someguy_2322123: 2699 : >I believe it is more likely that it's down to personal experience rather than preference. The supermarkets around me probably have a largely different selection than the supermarkets around you.

That is possible, I live in a very rural area, so the selection at the market isn't great.

>When a baby cow is born, it's taken almost immediately away from its mother and locked in a crate, because if it stayed around it would drink the milk.

While the baby cows are moved, what exactly do you think they drink?  It is milk, they are bottle feed for a few days, then they drink out of a pail.  But they still drink the milk.  And I think crate is the wrong word, they go into specific pens, but they don't have a top so i wouldn't call it a crate?  At leat what that farmer used.

>A mother cow's bond with her young is very strong that she tries to chase after the babies and sometimes cries out for days in search of her baby.

My personal experience disagrees with this.  The dairy cows that I saw were pretty ok with the situation.  When they were close to giving birth, they were put in a specific barn/pen, then after they gave birth, the mother went right back to her routine, there was no forcing her needed.

I don't know how the cows felt about their situation, but they seemed pretty ok with it.  Honest question, have you ever worked on a farm and worked with these abused captive cows?  They are pretty simple creatures, and as long as they have time in the pasture, and food they seem pretty happy.  I honestly don't know some of the specifics about mastitis rate, or life span so i can't comment.

>For you it comes down to taste vs taste and you don't care about the environment, health, farm animals, the fish and animals affected by deforestation? Is this true? Don't take this is as an attack, I just wish to be sure if I'm understanding you correctly.

I live in a farming area, I buy most of my meat locally.  I sometimes go onto the farms to buy it from the farmer (cheaper in bulk).  I just have a hard time looking at a guy's farm and accepting that it just isn't sustainable and should be closed, when there are lots of options that can be done to lower environmental impact.  

Health wise, my doctor hasn't told me that I should modify my diet, so i'm not going to worry about it.

With the farm animals I have seen, I think they live an acceptable life.

I don't eat a lot of fish, especially not from an ocean, so i am not sure my consumption makes a difference.

And i'm not sure what deforestation has to do with it?  If all of the meat farms around here stopped farming meat, they would still farm something, so it isn't like they would return to being forest/plains?

R2-666: 9585 : Hey, sorry about the late reply! Also the following took me hours to write, so I really appreciate if you read all of it with an open mind.

Since you live in a rural/farming area, then I do believe it's different and that those dairy cows are being treated better - unless they still die at the age of 4-6, which would show they are still being exhausted to death.

I was talking about the dairy cows that supply large supermarkets in cities, their living conditions account for the majority of the cows.

And since you buy locally, you don't contribute to the transportation created pollution - that's very good.

> Have you ever worked on a farm and worked with these abused captive cows?

No. My information only comes from countless hours of research, books, documentaries that are not about isolated incidents, but about the industry standards.

>I live in a farming area. With the farm animals I have seen, I think they live an acceptable life.

I hope this does not sound deprecating, because I write this with respect, but the conditions of smaller-scale farms don't apply to the majority of large factory farms that supply large supermarkets.

>While the baby cows are moved, what exactly do you think they drink?

On a factory farm, cow’s milk is not intended for baby cows – it’s intended for humans. They are taken from their mothers as soon as two hours after birth, and are either fed a commercial milk replacer that is made from dried milk powder, or they are fed milk that has been deemed unfit for human consumption.

Once again, I believe it can be different in small-scale farms, but that doesn't account for the majority of factory farms.
>The dairy cows that I saw were pretty ok with the situation, and as long as they have time in the pasture. After they gave birth, the mother went right back to her routine, there was no forcing her needed.

Interesting.
Perhaps due to better conditions in smaller-scale farms they trust people more and don't panic?

And they never searched for their baby later? 
I find that hard to believe if that's what you mean, having researched animal instincts and having seen video footage.

Not calling you a liar, just finding it difficult to believe that the mother cow would show no reaction seeing her baby taken away, or that she would not search for her later. Are they reunited later? Maybe that's why if that's the case. Very interesting.

> They are pretty simple creatures, and as long as they have time in the pasture, and food they seem pretty happy.

About the simplicity - Cows are highly aware and sentient. They demonstrate their interests, likes, dislikes, needs and desires. They display depression, frustration, anger, hostility, fear and despair when we deny them the conditions that allow them to freely express themselves, as is the case on farms.

About happiness - I wonder if our perspective of happiness can be applied to cows.
Do we decide they are happy because we think they look happy? Perhaps a cow or any animal is unhappy, already by us denying them their instincts.

> I just have a hard time looking at a guy's farm and accepting that it just isn't sustainable and should be closed, when there are lots of options that can be done to lower environmental impact. 

I'm not saying it's unsustainable for the farm owner. I'm saying it's unsustainable for the planet.

Going vegan is the **easiest** and the most **efficient** way of lowering environmental impact - the biggest obstacle is within. People like to demand change, but they don't want to change themselves.

Apart from just buying us more time, using other options to lower environmental impact is useless if we don't get rid of animal agriculture, because that alone would still keep us from solving the problems.

Like I wrote earlier, if we would all stop using gas, oil, fuel, electricity forever, we would still exceed our carbon equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of 565 gigatons by the year 2030 just with the impact of livestock alone.

We have over 1 billion cows alive right now.

Every single cow produces methane.

Methane is 25-100 times more destructive than CO2, and has 86 times the global warming power.

If we do reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere, it will take around 100 years to see a decline, whereas reducing methane shows results almost immediately with significant result within decades.

Like I wrote in an earlier reply, livestock is responsible for **65%** of all emissions of nitrous oxide - a greenhouse gas 296 times more destructive than carbon dioxide and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years.

Also, a farm with 2,500 dairy cows produces the same amount of waste as a city of 411,00 people.
Every minute, 7 million pounds of excrement are produced by animals raised for food in the US alone. This doesn't include animals raised outside of USDA jurisdiction or in backyards. And it all has no proper management system, leading to ground water and ocean pollution.

>And i'm not sure what deforestation has to do with it?

A third of the planet is desertified, with livestock as the **leading** cause.
1.5 acres can produce 37,000 pounds of plant-based food and only 375 pounds of meat.
The land required to feed 1 vegan for 1 year is 1/6th of an acre. It is 3x as much for a vegetarian and 18x as much for a meat-eater.
You can grow 15x more protein on any given area of land with plans, rather than animals.

136 **million** rainforest acres have been cleared for animal agriculture, with 1-2 acres of rainforest being cleared every second.
Animal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction.

>Health wise, my doctor hasn't told me that I should modify my diet, so i'm not going to worry about it.

Here's a few passages from "How Not To Die" by physician Michael Greger, who by the way makes no money from the book sales and from his website, even though it's a Best Seller. Money goes straight to charity.
>**1)** Most deaths in the United States are preventable, and they are related to what we eat. Our diet is the number-one cause of premature death and the number-one cause of disability. Surely, diet must also be the number-one thing taught in medical schools, right?

>Sadly, it's not. According to the most recent national survey, only a quarter of medical schools offer a single course in nutrition, down from 37% thirty years ago. While most of the public evidently considers doctors to be "very credible" sources of nutrition information, six out of sever graduating doctors surveyed felt physicians were inadequately trained to counsel patients about their diets.

>**2)** I was honored to be accepted by nineteen medical schools. I chose Tufts because they boasted the most nutrition training - twenty one hours worth, although this was still less than 1 percent of the curriculum.

>Even with our paltry twenty-one hours of nutrition training, there was no mention of using diet to treat chronic disease, let alone reverse it.

>**3)** The U.S. healthcare system runs on a fee-for-service model in which doctors get paid for the pills and the procedures they prescribe, rewarding quantity over quality. We don't get reimbursed for time spent counseling our patients about the benefits of healthy eating. If doctors were paid for performance, there would be a financial incentive to treat the lifestyle cause of disease.

>**4)** **(about lobbying)** Research showing that coronary heart disease can be reversed with a plant-based diet --with or without other healthy lifestyle changes-- has been published for decades in some of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Why hasn't this news translated into public policy yet?

>In 1977, the U.S Senate Committee on Nutrition and Human needs tried to do just that. They released "Dietary Goals for the United States", a report advising Americans to cut down on animal-based foods and increase their consumption of planet-based foods. As a founding member of Harvard University's nutrition department recalls, "The meat, milk and egg producers were very upset." That's an understatement.

>Under industry pressure, not only was the goal to "decrease meat consumption" removed from the report but the entire Senate nutrition committee was disbanded. Several prominent senators reputedly lost their election bids as a result of support the report.

>In more recent years, it was uncovered that many members of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee had financial ties to everything from chocolate bars companies to entities like McDonald's Council on Healthy Lifestyles and Coca-Cola's Beverage Institute for Health and Wellness.
One committee member even served as "brand girl" for cake-mix maker Duncan Hines and then as the official Crisco "brand girl" before going on to help write the official Dietary Guidelines for Americans - which included **no** discussion at all of the scientific research on the health consequences of eating meat.

>If the Committee actually discussed this research, it would be unable to justify its recommendation to eat meat, as the research would show that meat increases the risks of chronic diseases, contrary to the purposes of the Guidelines. Thus, by simply ignoring that research, the Committee is able to reach a conclusion that would otherwise look improper.

>**5)** For the majority of Americans who die suddenly from heart disease, the very first symptom may be their last. You may not even realize you are at risk until it's too late. That's why it's critical to prevent heart disease in the first place, before you even necessarily know you have it.

> but about the industry standards.

>but the conditions of smaller-scale farms don't apply to the majority of large factory farms that supply large supermarkets.

It sounds like you have a larger problem with large scale factory farms.  I am not a fan of those farms either, they take large amounts of government subsidies and push prices down for smaller farms, which make it harder for them to survive.

>Perhaps due to better conditions in smaller-scale farms they trust people more and don't panic?
And they never searched for their baby later? I find that hard to believe if that's what you mean, having researched animal instincts and having seen video footage.

I don't have a full view into it, but there was one time we went up to the barn with our niece to talk to the farmer and visit the cows, and there was a day(?) old calf in a pen and she was curious about where her mom was, etc.  And he told us about how he handles the birthing process.  When a cow is close to giving birth, it goes to a specific pen overnight, (makes it safer for the calf to not stumble into the manure trench, or get stepped on) and in the morning if she gave birth, the cow goes out to pasture with the rest of the cows, and the calf goes to the calf pens.  I can't say 100% that the cow never cares, but the when asked, the farmer said that the cow just goes back to her normal routine.  the calf pens were near their normal path of travel so for at least some period of time, they would see each other.  Then after that, it depends on the sex, females are kept and join the herd, the males go to market.  I can't really say more than that, because that is all I know.

>About the simplicity - Cows are highly aware and sentient. They demonstrate their interests, likes, dislikes, needs and desires. They display depression, frustration, anger, hostility, fear and despair when we deny them the conditions that allow them to freely express themselves, as is the case on farms.

All things are relative, would a cow be happier in a cow sanctuary probably. But that was a point I made previously, that option isn't there, the only other options for these cows is to not exist.  If everyone went vegan tomorrow, there wouldn't be a ton of happy cows expressing themselves, there would just be almost no cows expressing themselves at all.  I don't see how that a more restrained existence is worse than no existence.

>About happiness - I wonder if our perspective of happiness can be applied to cows. Do we decide they are happy because we think they look happy? Perhaps a cow or any animal is unhappy, already by us denying them their instincts.

That really is impossible to say, if you are going to compare them to animals in the wild left to their instincts, the struggle for food and the fear of predators are real concerns.  So I would say it is anyone's guess which makes the animal more happy.

>I'm saying it's unsustainable for the planet.

>Every single cow produces methane.

And as I said previous I believe that most of the sustainable issues can be fixed by either new technology, or reduction.  I remember seeing some articles about promising results of a certain type of seaweed reducing methane emissions in cattle.  I can't say that it will amount to anything, but you also can't say that there isn't any way of reducing methane from cattle.  

>livestock is responsible for 65% of all emissions of nitrous oxide - a greenhouse gas 296 times more destructive than carbon dioxide and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years.

https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#nitrous-oxide

Agricultural soil management is the largest source of N2O emissions in the United States, accounting for about 79 percent of total U.S. N2O emissions in 2014. Nitrous oxide is also emitted during the breakdown of nitrogen in livestock manure and urine, which contributed to 4 percent of N2O emissions in 2014.

Seems like 4% directly?  I couldn't find a good source of what percentage of farmland is used for animal feed, but seems like 40-60% depending on the crop/source.  So at the high end, still only 51%.  I am not sure that the 47% really matter though, that farm land would still be there and be used if meat production stopped?  

https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#agriculture

If I am to understand this chart, then Agriculture as a whole is 9% of emissions, 


>Also, a farm with 2,500 dairy cows produces the same amount of waste as a city of 411,00 people.

And? Cows are also a lot larger than people...?

>And it all has no proper management system, leading to ground water and ocean pollution.

There are a lot of efforts being put forward by farmers to reduce the run off.  

>Every minute, 7 million pounds of excrement are produced by animals raised for food in the US alone. 

Which is being used to fertilize the crops that we and the cows eat.  If that manure wasn't available, we would need to use a lot more chemical fertilizer.  Which have similar run-off problems as manure

>A third of the planet is desertified, with livestock as the leading cause.

I don't know a lot about this, but this guy seems to say that livestock can be part of the solution

https://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change

>136 million rainforest acres have been cleared for animal agriculture, with 1-2 acres of rainforest being cleared every second. Animal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction.

Seems like most of that land is going to soy bean production that is feed to cattle, if beef exports aren't valuable, they will still farm the lands and export the soy beans?  And if soy beans aren't needed for food, they can still be turned into bio fuels, among other things.  This seems to me as more of a policy problem, rather than a current use problem.

So it seems to me that through technology improvements, reduction in consumption, changes in factory farming practices, and education / practice changes, the environmental impact is manageable.


>The U.S. healthcare system runs on a fee-for-service model in which doctors get paid for the pills and the procedures they prescribe, rewarding quantity over quality.

I would disagree with this, when I see the dr, he is paid a flat fee, and he doesn't get paid from prescriptions that are filled.

>We don't get reimbursed for time spent counseling our patients about the benefits of healthy eating.

If he means that there isn't a specific billing code for this, then sure.  But my doctor discusses eating habits when I am there, to not do it seems like a doctor taking a shortcut.

My brother was complaining last year that he had high cholesterol and his doctor told him to modify his diet and eat less meat,  he wasn't prescribed anything.

I'm sure that there are doctors out there who just prescribe something, and don't put any extra work into it, but they would just be bad/lazy doctors.

>If doctors were paid for performance, there would be a financial incentive to treat the lifestyle cause of disease.

I'm not sure i understand how this would work.  I am a health person, I don't see a dr often, so should they get some payment for each visit i don't need to make?  A side effect of this could be that sicker patients (through diet or otherwise) wouldn't be accepted.  Because if healthier people meant that an office was passively paid, why would they take the older or "high maintenance" people.  

Medicare did add a readmission penalty, but that is for larger procedures, and i'm not sure a conversation about diet would make an impact in the timeline that it is looking for.






R2-666: 6668 : > It sounds like you have a larger problem with large scale factory farms.

After all they are the **bigger** problem because they are the **bigger** percent of the animal agriculture.
But saying which I have a bigger problem with is a useless argument to make anyway, or w/e you want to call it.

If you get rid of the large scale factory farms, small farms would take their place by becoming big farms to feed all the meat eaters, which would keep up the population of cows producing methane and which would keep up the deforestation to feed these cows.

You're not going to feed 7 billion people consistently via small organic farms.

And, no matter if it's a large scale factory farm or a small scale farm, they both kill sentient beings which is immoral and unnecessary to survive.

I don't eat animals for the same reasons I wouldn't eat dogs or humans.

And you wouldn't eat a human even if science said it's healthy to do so.
In case you are thinking "but that's humans, it's different from animals,", look up speciesism.

> If everyone went vegan tomorrow, there wouldn't be a ton of happy cows expressing themselves, there would just be almost no cows expressing themselves at all.
 
Lets not backwards rationalize. Nobody breeds cows so those cows can happily express themselves. We breed them to breastfeed ourselves as adults, and we breed them to kill them for their meat and leather. We breed them for us, not for them.

And we don't need over 1 billion cows roaming this earth, each of them producing very destructive methane, and each of them requiring huge amounts of food - it is unsustainable.

If everyone went vegan, the cow population would drop largely - that is a good thing.

> I don't see how that a more restrained existence is worse than no existence.

Really? With that same logic, slavery is better than not existing.

If you had only two choices, would you choose to be a slave or not to exist?

> And as I said previous I believe that most of the sustainable issues can be fixed by either new technology, or reduction.

It is very comfortable and blissful to live believing that someone else will solve the problems for us, without us having to do a thing.

What new technology? What technology would it be when all the oceans are empty of the fish? Are we gonna clone **b**illions of fish?

What technology when all of the forests have been cut down and the animals from those forests dead?

What new technology when climate change has gone too far and is unstoppable?

If the oceans die, WE die.

If the bees die, WE die.

Everything is intertwined.

I'm sorry to say this, but you are underestimating the urgency of these things.

Think of climate change as a car that is constantly accelerating its speed towards a wall. By the time we see that wall, we press on the break pedal, but it'll be too late, the car will still be moving towards it. When we finally saw the wall, it was already too close and we've crashed. The only way to not crash, is to slow down the speed before we even see the wall. But we keep increasing that speed instead.

> You also can't say that there isn't any way of reducing methane from cattle. 

But with the increasing cow population the methane production will still be too high. Unless it removes all methane production?

Which still won't solve the deforestation to feed this increasing cow population.

Interesting video, watched all of it.

Here is a counter argument to it by someone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5BqDyDrj8E

> Rainforests - Seems like most of that land is going to soy bean production that is feed to cattle

Like you said yourself - cows are much larger than humans.
I understand it's not the point you are making, but I'll say it anyway. If everyone went vegan we are not gonna need as much soy and therefore keep up the deforestation.
Animal agriculture is **the** problem.

I wouldn't worry about bio fuels as it clearly states that animal agriculture is the leading cause. Now bio fuels is truly something we can solve with technology (electric cars).

> My brother was complaining last year that he had high cholesterol and his doctor told him to modify his diet and eat less meat

You can eat less and hit yourself with a smaller hammer, but why hit yourself with a hammer at all?
Even eating less meat is behind so many diseases.

>I'm sure that there are doctors out there who just prescribe something, and don't put any extra work into it, but they would just be bad/lazy doctors.

Well, it accounts for the majority. They are doing what they've been taught, and the numbers tell us how little they are being taught about nutrition.

>"The U.S. healthcare system runs on a fee-for-service model in which doctors get paid for the pills and the procedures they prescribe, rewarding quantity over quality."

>I would disagree with this, when I see the dr, he is paid a flat fee, and he doesn't get paid from prescriptions that are filled.

The bulk of most doctors’ pay is still based on fee-for-service contracts. Only because it's different for you doesn't mean it's like that for millions of other people.

>"If doctors were paid for performance, there would be a financial incentive to treat the lifestyle cause of disease."

>so should they get some payment for each visit i don't need to make?

I don't follow how you get to that conclusion.

>A side effect of this could be that sicker patients (through diet or otherwise) wouldn't be accepted.

Only if it would be like the scenario you suggested. 

But in terms of how it's meant, it's actually the contrary. They would make more money off the sicker people.

This is going to be my last reply to you. But only because I am so so busy and I don't have much time for reddit. You can check from my post history how rarely I post.

I leave you with this: 

Read the science book, "How Not to Die" by Michael Greger.

It's for your own sake if you don't want to die prematurely or have your loved ones suffer and die prematurely.

The amount of diseases and health problems behind the consumption of meat is so insane, that I myself would not have believed it if you had told me a few years ago.
I loved meat and I hated vegans.

Even if all of the environmental problems are solved, even if you don't care enough about animals - there is still the health issue. 

The book will cause you a paradigm shift.

And finally, a quote by Albert Einstein: 

"The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything." 

I wish you a long and a happy life. Take care! :)

BetterToNeverBe: 241 : Why can't you care about human suffering and animal suffering? It's not as if one is at jeopardy when caring about the other. 

The fact you would find it more important to "try new things" than politely decline a meal is frankly disturbing.

Vorpal12: 61 : Why does the fact that it tastes good make it okay to eat it?

ACBD3: 93 : Have you tried dog? At least give a few different cuts/ways of cooking a go before you judge.

Gezza44: 101 : So it's ok to kill and eat dogs, you just personally don't? Because that's all your argument implies.

deep_webber: 16 : I kill many dogs

Gezza44: 158 : "Its ok to kill dogs" you therefore do not love them and are not in the demographic that op is trying to debate ("dog-lovers")

why did you edit your comment?

Ariellefay: 159 : Have you had dog? People around the world eat dog. We are conditioned to think eating one domestic animal is ok while eating the other is not. I don't get it. 

deep_webber: 22 : I eat dog it's quality

Merkmerkm: 320 : Compared to herbivores most omnivores/carnivores just doesn't taste as good. Generally speaking of course. Dogs are easy and cheap to breed so some people eat them like the west eats beef/pork.

It is much more about efficiency and taste. We use more or less the entirety of the pig/cow. Dogs don't have much to offer.



Neverlife: 61 : But that's not true. Dog tastes pretty good from what I hear.

deep_webber: 21 : I might try dog then.

Neverlife: 85 : I believe that choice to be equally as unethical as choosing to eat any other animal.

Genoskill: 64 : therefore your argument is garbage.

Aeternalis_: 250 : I am not responsible for the overpopulation of Earth (and I am not going to have children so I won't be reproducing) which is the cause of the suffering of animals in slaughter houses.

Humans are omnivores and benefit greatly from meat. 

That's it.

Vorpal12: 98 : Humans can be healthy without meat.  See [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/dieteticorgs)

BetterToNeverBe: 211 : I won't be reproducing either. I also don't own a car. I bike to work. That doesn't give me cause to go do some other horrible thing with my life. 

The cause of the suffering you pay for and you consume is you.

Aeternalis_: 116 : I am a human and a meat eater. Are lions monsters because they eat meat? No, they're following evolutionary biology.

BetterToNeverBe: 126 : You just told me you're human, not a lion. You're an omnivore evolved from herbivores. You can eat meat but you don't have to.

Ihaveperkyboobs: 200 : Same here. I do not get vegans who have children and think they're doing something good for animals and the environment. All the cheese they turn down is completely nullified by their having children.

Shunted23: 243 : Do you advocate for suicide? You most certainly have a net negative effect on the environment. And what is the end game for the child free philosophy? Human extinction? No one around to appreciate the environment you seem so concerned about?



Ihaveperkyboobs: 468 : Oh dear, dude we have 7 billion people, you really think we're gonna die out soon? Your argument is as intellectually dishonest as the meat eaters "but if everyone switched to vegan right now we'd have allllll these wild cows running around, who'd milk them????". Come on dude.



No I'm not pro suicide but I'm also not vegan and pro "I must avoid any suffering (but only if it's convenient cause skipping cheese is easy but I do need two cars and three babies duhh)"

Shunted23: 410 : > Oh dear, dude we have 7 billion people, you really think we're gonna die out soon?

Well if you take your position to it’s logical conclusion, then yes.

> Your argument is as intellectually dishonest as the meat eaters "but if everyone switched to vegan right now we'd have allllll these wild cows running around, who'd milk them????".

Their argument is easily countered. As is yours. No dishonesty here.

morganshmorgan: 2363 : I love both, in different ways. I have been socially conditioned and raised to view dogs as companions, and cows as food. 

I love dogs because they have been bred to love me. I love cows because they have been bred to taste good, or make lots of protein-packed milk. I like dairy products. 

That being said I’m not blind to the problems these products pose the environment, but I’m also not blind to the centuries of human tradition and knowledge surrounding agriculture and the domestication of livestock. I buy from local farms/businesses and do my best to know what conditions the animals lived in before I consume them for energy. Farming is the livelihood for countless families for god knows how many generations, and for many of them it’s not only an identity issue but it’s all they know. As long as they are treating their animals and the land respectfully and sustainably, then they get my dollar. 

I still believe there is balance to be found in this, we just all have to consciously work toward it. I’m an animal science major attempting to overhaul the food system to make it possible to phase out mass-production of animal products. Unfortunately, we need to change the societal factor first and foremost otherwise CAFOs and other massive operations will be the only production systems left that are economically viable, which spells disaster for the planet and human health. In my opinion scare-tactics from “all-or-nothing” vegans and consumer choice won’t help sway die-hard “carnivores”, or save animal lives. All that does is hurt small farmers’ profits and inevitably send their herds directly to slaughter, or worse, into the hands of someone who doesn’t have the time or energy to care about every individual animals’ needs. I believe open, honest, and scientific conversation without emotionally manipulative propaganda is the best route to compromise from all sides. 

If you’re going to consume an animal, regardless of species, at least give it a comfortable and pain-free life. 

(If you’re curious, I don’t really eat much meat anymore. Far from vegan though. I’m obsessed with eggs, milk, and butter because those are key ingredients in nearly every single recipe I ever learned growing up. Cooking was a huge part of my childhood, and it’s hard to unlearn that shit. Especially while working full time and trying to get a degree.)

Tikke: 244 : You're right, it's just a game. But many people treat it as a hobby. Expending high amounts of income and time to better their craft, since this is a simulator. So, when a shitbird decides to intentionally wreck you it's not absurd to be upset.

LukeFalknor: 220 : Agree. However, if a "shitbird" first crashes me out of a race with just a dirty maneuver, blood may boil... Not saying that is what happened here, but I would be _very_ upset if I was Scott Speed in that first incident.

Hugo_5t1gl1tz: 161 : Scott Speed has a history of douchey behavior. Takes away any credibility. 99.999% of people who may be upset at the initial incident would not have retaliated. 

LukeFalknor: 233 : Oh, well... Just another one, than.

It's not like Schmalenbach isn't a douche, or other Pro/high iRating drivers aren't douches too... Yes, fast douches, but still.

LukeFalknor: 381 : > Not saying that is what happened here

That was a racing incident. But I do understand the driver who lost the position and got out of the race being upset, even more when you consider that iRacing netcode may be a little bogus sometimes, and may have shown the other car going a little more towards him on his PC.

Inexcusable reaction, but people are humans, and may get upset.
