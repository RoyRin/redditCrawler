Janse,With all the cuts. I cant believe you kept the scene where Bombur's barrel is bouncing around hitting every Orc with MLG headshots, and then he pops out and is a spinning barrel ninja. 

Out of all the shitty Hollywood scenes I think that was my most hated one. 

Oh well, good job with the rest.

XeroRequiem,The barrel didnt even have a scope though. How could he not include those high quality MLG noscopes?

Simpsoid,360 no-scope yo! XxXx420_BoMBuR_1337_xXxX

anman20,That's the point, the barel can noscope because it lacks one.

ipeeinyourshower,You left the GoPro shots in the barrel ride.  These need to be gone.

Mendonza,Could that really be done without the music sounding way off?

ipeeinyourshower,That's one thing I was actually wondering about the rest of the cut, was if there were music issues.

Someone on the inside needs to get us the mix minus the soundtrack so we can rescore and trim the film to perfection.

Mendonza,I'm trying to start my own personal cut too, but that's one of my two issues, the other being how to edit the on-screen title "An Unexpected Journey" to "There and Back Again".

I really don't know what to do with the music in examples like the one you mentioned. I would like to extract the GoPro shots, but I have no idea how to make it look seamless without making the score sound horrible.

None,Regarding the title, I finally just had to completely cut that title shot out and place the new title somewhere else.

None,Those gopro shots were the worst, most immersion breaking, sacks of shit imaginable. And that is saying a lot, considering they had to stand out sandwiched I the middle of the worst CGI peacocking I have ever seen in a movie. I'd almost rather watch Peter Jackson masturbate with his hairy nut sack resting on a pile of money for six minutes, because that's basically what it was.

Rain12913,Every minute he was on screen I found myself lamenting the fact that it would be an extra minute that I'd be sitting in the theater at the end of the night.  It was that bad.  "Please don't tell me that's going to be that fucking guy dressed in drag....oh fuck no"

Edrondol,Please torrent the high-res version of this and hope it stays up. I won't be able to download anything until I get off work in 3 hours. I will seed the shit out of this.

By the way, the barrel trip and the Smaug attacking the Dwarves are two of my least favorite parts of the movies. Talk about adding nothing to the story for the sake of video game-like generic action sequences.

SonOfSalem,I have to say The Investigation  of Dol Guldur was my favorite addition. 

None,Yeah as a casual fan of Hobbit/LOTR I enjoyed a bit of kick-ass magic. Gandalf is the most boring wizard ever. No lightning bolts. Doesn't turn  orc army into mice or kittens. Hermione would kick Gandalf's ass. And Dumbledore? Please. He mostly just rides around telling people things. At least 80% of what Gandalf does could be performed by a smartphone. 

Edledhron,Gandalf does do some flashy magic from time to time - calling lightning down upon the Ringwraiths on Weathertop and during his fight with the balrog, his encounter with Sauron's wolves, etc. If Gandalf went up against any wizard from Harry Potter, it's fairly safe to say that he would win.

That said, the scenes in these films are simply out of tone, and did indeed feel like something from the Harry Potter films rather than Tolkien's world.

None,Yeah my BF tells me he's basically an Angel and he's actually a badass but in the films you just don't get a sense of that. 

Edledhron,And for a good reason -- the wizards were sent to Middle-earth by the gods in the forms of humble, old men precisely so that they would not be thought of as 'angels to lead the charge!' Very few in Middle-earth even knew that they were angels while they were present. One only gets a sense of their true nature in the direst of emergencies, where the only solution is for them to reveal some of their power.

yunomakerealaccount,He's [Maiar](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Maiar), on the same "level" of deity as Sauron and the Balrogs (basically a demigod), and one of five wizards (Istari) sent by the gods (Valar) to combat the evil influences of Sauron in the Third Age.

When Gandalf says he's the "wielder of the Secret Fire" when fighting the Balrog he's not fucking around; he's the owner of one of the Elven Rings of Power, Narya, the ring of fire, which inspires hope in mortals. He was given it by the Elf who builds the ships that take them to the Undying Lands.

Gandalf's the only one of the Five Istari who accomplishes his mission, and the only one who returns to Valinor instead of becoming corrupt or perishing.

None,Yeah but Hermione could just turn him into a teapot. It's hard to wield the sacred fire when some six year old is using you to serve chamomile to her cats. 

mexter,No problem. Make an edit that contains only that as a separate short film.

dagens24,I enjoyed it as well but I think it really would have worked much better as a stand alone film.

Turtle1515,It should be it's own movie with this type of cut in mind

CouldBeBetterForever,I enjoyed it too. Does it need to be in the film? No. But I don't think it hurts the film in any way. 

None,[deleted]

Nfrizzle,When I found out they were making the Hobbit into movies the first two things I got excited about were, Smaug, and that we would finally get to see what Gabdalf was up to.  Those were some of the best scenes in my opinion, minus Radagast, and the main reason I was alright with 3 movies.

blekkja,It would have been better as its own thing like Del Toro was going to do. A real shame he pulled out: I'd suspect nobody would be bothering with edits if he had directed.

None,Del Toro isn't god, he's made absolute garbage before too case in point Pacific Rim which is worse than any Jackson movie.

blekkja,Pacific Rim was supposed to be awful. He gets a pass on that.

Edledhron,Jackson's made some stinkers...

KTY_,> Pacific Rim which is worse than any Jackson movie

Pacific Rim was meant to be a fun movie and it delivered. I don't know what you expected from it. Giant monster/robot movies are very rarely anything more than mindless popcorn entertainment. 

None,It didn't deliver that either. It is honestly worse than the first transformers movie.

KTY_,gr8 b8 m8

kopkiwi,Based on what exactly?

blekkja,Mainly because he was going to film the hobbit first, and then another movie to link that and LoTR. Which was an awesome idea, and would have worked really well.


Also at this point in time I prefer him to Jackson as an Auteur too.

Fsoprokon,It was produced with LotR in mind.  I know that's obvious, but that's why.

ehsahr,Me too. I wonder how well it would go together as a short film all on its own? 

MasterEk,It would make more sense to bring it in around the Council of Elrond, when it appears in the narrative.

Secil12,I was thinking the same thing, remove it from the Fan cut of the Hobbit and put it together as an LOTR short.

InTheAtticToTheLeft,jackson should have stopped at 2, if not 1 hobbit film, leaving gandalf's whereabouts during his absence a mystery.  then, perhaps a couple years later, release 'The Necromancer' - a darker film, more along the lines and genre of LotR detailing the battle at Dol Guldur and filling in or expounding on all the mountains of background lore that he has access to which enrich both series'. leave [nearly] all the cameos (legolas, galadriel etc), any new characters (tauriel) for this film; keep the hobbit pure and streamlined - its for kids after all

the hobbit should be about *the hobbit* that gets swept up in someone else's adventure, way above his depth and forced to find the strength inside himself that no one could have known was there.  also, (which i *thought* should have been obvious) this hobbit is not a warrior, and gandalfs choice of and vouching for him should have remained a mystery for all involved until the very end ([this would *never* happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR2y-3Q75s4))

Edledhron,Jackson did not have a mountain of lore at his disposal. He had brief statements, glimpses, and short summaries. He used that material to create his own fan-fiction, not at all aligned with Tolkien's lore.

blouderkirk,I'm confused, do you really mean he didn't have a mountain of lore available or that he just didn't do his research properly?

Muskwatch,he means that the mountain of lore he had available was locked out of access by copyright, and he had to be careful not to overtly use information that he could not garner from the hobbit, the LOTR and the appendices.

blouderkirk,Ah ok, thanks

glglglglgl,It's why Gandalf and Radagast can discuss that there were other wizards (because the quantity of them was noted within the LOTR books or appendices) but not their actual names (which I believe first appeared in the Silmarillion). 

rishav_sharan,I dont think Jackson is ever held back by lack of lore. :p   
We can always have a new love triangle between Sauron, Gandalf and Legolas.

Altereggodupe,Who *wouldn't* love Gandalf's pointy hat trick?But Sam will kill him if he tries anything.

None,>  'The Necromancer' - a darker film, more along the lines and genre of LotR detailing the battle at Dol Guldur and filling in or expounding on all the mountains of background lore that he has access to which enrich both series'.

I simply don't think there is enough material to create a movie. The problem with filling the rest of the movie with background lore is that you have to go a lot into Middle Earth history. The movie would be going all over the place and there wouldn't be a consistent theme or character. It would literally be a movie of flash backs. 

jasondickson,*(Shrugs)* There wasn't enough material to make 3 Hobbit movies, but then greed showed up ...

Edledhron,And a poor film trilogy was the result.

None,However, the hobbit was long enough to put filler material in-between the stretched fibers. 

The above necromancer film doesn't even that except if you want a movie of disjointed flashbacks from different time periods with no real relevance to one another. 

cptnflinty,IIRC Jackson only had access to material in LOTR and The Hobbit - anything outside of these published books he can't show as he didn't have the copyright access. 

Unfortunately the Tolkien estate has locked all the other copyrights down and refuse to look at other film adaptations. 

SiliconGhosted,Why is the tolkein estate so upset about the films? I know there was an issue with royalties and the studio's being money pinching assholes. Is that the only reason though?

Newdist2,And the part where Jackson butchered the theme of the books.

blekkja,I think the estate has been proven justified after these cock ups. I really enjoyed the LoTR films (and Braindead / Frighteners etc) but by association I just can't get into them any more.

kopkiwi,That's...stupid.

blekkja,[Citation Needed]

None,My understanding is that they were also motivated by the fact that the film company involved tried to use accounting tricks to claim that the films didn't make any profit, leading numerous actors as well as the Tolkien Trust to have to sue to get what their contracts stated.

You_meddling_kids,No film makes a profit, that "trick" has been going on for decades.

None,> Unfortunately the Tolkien estate has locked all the other copyrights down and refuse to look at other film adaptations. 

I think they did this because they didn't get a good cut of the movie because of "Hollywood accounting" aka lots of mysterious costs so the Movie makes less on paper than it actually does - thus resulting in lower taxes and they didn't have to pay the Tolkein estate in mountains of royalties. 

jyjjy,Only noobs don't negotiate based on percent off the top.

Edledhron,The Tolkien Estate's stance on not licensing out the works precedes Jackson's films entirely. That stance has only been made high profile due to the implications for any hypothetical future Middle-earth films from Jackson, and so many believe that the cause is Jackson's films. It is not, though these films have certainly done nothing to change the Estate's stance.

None,Then why did they license LOTR? 

Edledhron,They didn't. Tolkien himself sold the rights for *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* to cover tax expenses.

None,ahh

SlowpokesBro,If I recall, Tolkien sold the movie rights for only a few thousand dollars because e thought nobody would ever make a good movie.  

TolkienEditor,The thing is, I would love to have seen a movie focusing just on Gandalf's adventures  from pre-Hobbit to early LOTR - his investigation of Dol Guldor, his discovery of the One Ring, his adventures with Aragorn trying to track down Gollum.

That could have been a really dark, frightening, suspenseful film on it's own, but within the context of the Hobbit, it feels tonally at odds with the main story, and like Jackson is only nibbling around the edges for fan-service.

summinspicy,Sir Ian would have told Jackson to fuck off I imagine, all his recent interviews are about how much he hated working on green screen sets constantly during the hobbit.

turtlespace,The scene where they find the nine empty tombs with nine violently broken doors was by far my favorite scene in any of the three movies, despite Radagast being there. 

Its chilling, subtle, and uses what we know from the other movies without being irritating about it like all the other references. Those tombs are so damn cool too. 

Dethmoose,I was confused when I watched the movie during that scene. I don't know much about the lore on the ringwraiths, but it's it canon that they were imprisoned in the mountain like that? 
If true that was the coolest addition.

Edledhron,No, it isn't canon at all. The Ringwraiths were never killed and buried. If they were, they would have remained as impotent spirits wandering around until the destruction of the Ring or the end of the world.

After the Witch-king's defeat, the Ringwraiths did some minor stuff like capture Minas Ithil (renamed Minas Morgul), kill off the last king of Gondor until Aragorn, and prepare Sauron's lands for his return. But I'm sure the world wouldn't have noticed if they were off being buried somewhere...

Kerrigor2,As far as I know, Tolkien never touched on what happened to the Nine after Isildur 'defeated' Sauron. They were definitely *around* at that point, but what happened to them was never mentioned. While not strictly canon, something akin to their imprisonment is entirely possible, if not likely. 

Though, I did find information that said that Nine re-emerged in the year 1300 of the Third Age, whereas the events of The Hobbit occured in 2941. I'd find it difficult to believe that the Elves *and* the Wizards didn't notice the return of the Nine for 1641 years.

Edledhron,That's absolutely not true. We know a great deal of what the Ringwraiths were up to between the War of the Last Alliance and the War of the Ring, and they were never killed off, buried, and resurrected. Impossible, given that if they were killed, they would remain as impotent spirits until the destruction of the Ring or the end of the world.

The Wise, and others, certainly did know that the Ringwraiths did return. In 1100, Sauron secretly came to Dol Guldur, but the Wise believed it was a Ringwraith stirring up trouble. The Wise learned that the Lord of the Nazgûl was the 'Witch-king of Angmar' sometime after his appearance, and they knew all that he did. After his defeat, the Wise knew that the Ringwraiths had been assembled and that they had laid siege to the Gondorian fortress-city of Minas Ithil - not being killed and buried. That tower was captured and renamed Minas Morgul. Shortly afterwards, the Lord of the Nazgûl captures the last king of Gondor until Aragorn, who is never seen again. After that, the Wise learned of the Ringwraiths making ready for Sauron's return.

So no, their imprisonment is not possible.

Kerrigor2,Which, by the end of my comment, was pretty much what I was saying.

mon7gomery,My issue was that it completely changed the spirit of the story. Tolkien's Hobbit is a simple tale about Bilbo's adventure. There is something warm and friendly about the novel for me.

Jackson turned it into an epic, with a focus on battle and the dark forces of evil. The mood is more sober.

And as /u/TolkienEditor has alluded to, the film fails to centre the story of "The Hobbit" on the hobbit, which is a shame.

I like and enjoy the films in their own right, and accept that they are Jackson's works not Tolkien's. But I'm excited to see a version that is perhaps more true to the story I know and love.

sparta981,IIRC, Jackson originally wanted nothing to do with the prequels to begin with. He delivered well enough for me

Striker6g,>The mood is more sober

Somber?

mon7gomery,That too.

calliope720,Sober also works in this context, as it connotes the opposite of whimsy/merriment. Sober is often used in this way.

iongantas,There were a number of things in the films that may not have been in the book, but nevertheless took place at more or less the same time as in the movie, just off screen, specifically The Council of the Wise and knocking down Dol Guldur.

kopkiwi,Do you think Jackson tried too hard to make it a LOTR sequel rather than it's own story separate from the other movies?

Kiltmanenator,It did, but I don't mind the attempt because it's in alignment with what Tolkien himself tried to do in the 1960s. That Tolkien abandoned the project should have boded ill for anyone attempting such a reconciliation.

Kookanoodles,I think that was Jackson's intent, however. He didn't set out to adapt The Hobbit as a novel, he set out to adapt the events that transpire in Middle-Earth by the time The Hobbit takes place, with for the most part the same tone and scale as the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien himself once envisioned to rewrite The Hobbit in that way. As an adaptation of The Hobbit novel, Jackson's trilogy is quite poor; as an adaptation of Tolkien's stillborn re-written Hobbit story, it's a little better.

Edledhron,No, it isn't. Tolkien actually did begin rewriting *The Hobbit,* and got as far as Rivendell. Jackson's adaptation is no more like it than it is like *The Hobbit* as published. Furthermore, Tolkien abandoned the work upon the advice of a friend saying that it had lost the spirit of the original. It's something Jackson should have picked up on.

MasterEk,The purpose of the The Investigation of Dol Goldur is to provide background to the LotR films. That, also, is not a good idea: the books work with the gradual unfolding of what has happened.

The Dol Goldur sequence is good; situating it in the Fellowship where it appears in the original narrative (at the Council of Elrond, IIRC) would make some sense. Situating it in The hobbit weakens both films.



georgepennellmartin,I had an idea to place it as a flashback in the Council of Elrond scene.

SkeptioningQuestic,I forgive Peter Jackson that I think. It is logical to go from the children's story that was the hobbit to the adult story that was the LotR, that's a natural progression. It's harder to go from making three adult themed movies to three children's themed movies, especially when the studio has certain preconceptions about what people loved about the LotR movies.

goliath1333,I think the narratively it would make sense if they had done the investigation of Dol Guldur as a flash back, when Gandalf goes looking for Thorin's father and gets the map+key. I was actually very bummed that scene was not included in The Hobbit films.

That way you can build up the Dwarves backstory and give some good scene setting up Thorin.

secamTO,This is a pretty significant problem with most prequels (most notoriously the Star Wars prequels), often times a lot of air is wasted on showing us scenes that set up previous films in ways that the audience had already figured out (or were explained more simply and tantalizingly) in the earlier films.  More problematically, one has to wonder who these scenes are for:  if for the diehard fans of the originals, then there is no mystery to these setup scenes (because we've already seen the revelations in earlier films), and if for the newcomers, the inherent *wink-wink-nudge-nudge* nature of these callbacks will be lost.

Lucas succeeded in rendering the birth of Darth Vader (who in the original trilogy was a dark, fascinating villain) completely pedestrian and melodramatic in the prequel trilogy.

Jackson, in bringing so much peripheral Sauron business to the Hobbit trilogy has drawn attention and focus from the adventure of the book, and tried to wring exceptionally-obvious mystery from the identity of the dark one (who is so obviously, painfully Sauron).

Dramatically, I think prequels only work as films if they are purposed to do more than merely setup what we've already seen, in that their own storylines much comment on the previous storylines, as opposed to merely elaborating upon them.  One of the best examples I can think of is *The Godfather Part II*, where the events leading to Vito's rise to power don't merely setup what we've seen in the earlier film (and what we're seeing of his son intercut in number 2), but instead comments on the future storylines by showing how father and son traded away their souls.

Sybertron,It all could have been one scene though.  One single scene maybe 15 minutes long.  

ferlessleedr,That would be a cool fan edition. Also it would give you more information on the Nine after you initially meet them, so you'd have that fear of not knowing what they are (for a new viewer) and then Aragorn's bit about them at Weather top, then more chasing with more fear now that we've seen what they can do, finally a demonstration of their true power.

The only problem is that this would also give away Galadriel's big scene in Fellowship because she uses that power in Dol Goldur as well.

blackseaoftrees,Gandalf mentioning it briefly was enough for me. The actual scene felt like they were making it way too obvious, like HAY GUISE SAURON IS BACK. 

ntermation,the whole last movie felt like I was having the plot points shouted out me (in slow motion, with voice modulation) so I wouldn't get confused about what was actualy happening. 

thezlog,What if it was stuck at the end of the credits, Showing where gandalf was during his absence?

It'd be a long clip, but it would still give people the link and it IS a good piece, it just didn't exist in the book as "part" of the story being told by that book.

myripyro,Chronologically it's correct, no? The removal of Sauron from Mirkwood was done in Gandalf's absence from the Hobbit.

Unless you mean correct in the narrative - which I guess means it would work as a flashback in the Fellowship movie? 

anacrassis,> no?

Don't ever do this.

myripyro,There's nothing wrong with using colloquialisms in casual textual conversation, in my opinion.

anacrassis,Unless you're French, this isn't a colloquialism.

None,[deleted]

PersonUsingAComputer,No, the attack on Dol Guldur did take place during the events of The Hobbit. Gandalf even mentions to Bilbo on the return journey that he was gone because he was helping to drive the Necromancer out of Mirkwood.

ReverendMak,Just speaking in terms of narrative power and focus, it is much better to first just tell the simple story of the Hobbit, and only afterwards (in Fellowship) flash back to show that what seemed simple was actually just one facet of a much larger, darker tale. By sticking the investigation of DG in the Hobbit itself, they completely dismantled this powerful sequence of revelation as originally presented by Tolkien.

T-Money93,Yeah, it's in the appendix at the end of ROTK, so THAT part actually happened. It IS where Gandalf mysteriously disappeared to, doing secret wizard things. However, as much as I actually liked that scene, if one is to make the movie strictly from Bilbo's perspective (maybe, I don't know, like the book?) then it should be cut.

Edledhron,The White Council made an attack on Dol Guldur during the events of *The Hobbit*, which resulted in Sauron's departure for Mordor, and Gandalf was involved. That's about all that the Sauron/White Council subplot in Jackson's films has to do with Tolkien's lore - everything else chronological or not is more or less Jackson's fan-fiction, and very likely out of touch with Tolkien's material.

AnIce-creamCone,Fucking with the order of the narrative is Jacksons favorite thing. Like in LOTR when we know frodo is alive when the other fellowship members are shown his mythral shirt at the black gate. In the book you think Frodo has died and it's scary and uncertain. In the movie Frodo is already in the middle of Mordor at that point.  

mfranko88,That scene was originally cut out of the theatrical cut for that very reason. The audience knows exactly what is going on with Frodo at that time. But readers of the book are shitting their pants.

Jackson says somewhere in the makibg-if that he knows the scene doesn't play as well on film, so he left it out of the theatrical cut, but that it was still good enough of a scene to have in the extended cut. I think those are both good assessments.

glglglglgl,On the other hand, leaving things as they were in the book would result in it feeling like two seperate stories joined together in the middle, which doesn't work as well on film. 

stardustsuperwizard,It would also be confusing in the sense that you would be going "back in time" to see the other story.


MasterEk,Chronologically it's correct, but it doesn't sit there in the narrative. 

The reason for that could be as simple as Tolkien not having decided that the Necromancer was actually Sauron when he wrote the Hobbit, but it seems more likely that he made a deliberate decision around that.

In any case, if we make sense of why it appears at that point in the narrative, it gets really interesting:

* At the beginning of The Hobbit, Gandalf knows that the Necromancer is Sauron, but chooses not to tell anyone. This is a strategic decision which buys more time for the Council of the Wise, and so there is a logic to it.

* In The Hobbit, we get Bilbo’s perspective on the story, and he doesn’t know that Sauron is the Necromancer. Giving us this information earlier would require changing narrative voice, which would be disruptive; it would also weaken the focus on Bilbo’s adventures.

* At the beginning of the Fellowship, Frodo has no idea about Dol Guldur, or who the Necromancer is, or the significance of the One Ring. This unfolds gradually. As readers, we move along that journey with him (and Sam). By the time we get to the Council of Elrond we’ve got a great deal of information, and the full enormity of the situation is made clear.

Putting Dol Guldur into The Hobbit changes it; whatever Bilbo’s story is, and Thorin’s story is,  seems less significant than those events happening elsewhere.

It also changes The Fellowship--we wander into that narrative with a strong sense of the evil that Frodo is facing, rather than a slow-growing sense of dread.

In terms of narrative, directors often end up cutting really good scenes (like Dol Guldur) because they muddy the overall movie. 

In the film of The Fellowship, [“A total of four chapters and parts of a fifth are completely missing from the screenplay. The chapters are, 'A Short Cut to Mushrooms', 'A Conspiracy Unmasked', 'The Old Forest', 'In the House of Tom Bombadil', and 'Fog on the Barrow-downs'.”](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Movie_vs._Book:Fellowship_of_the_Ring) All four chapters are awesome. ‘A Shortcut to Mushrooms’ offers fantastic and relevant atmosphere, and ‘A Conspiracy Unmasked’ introduces Merry and Pippin brilliantly. ‘Fog on the Barrow-downs’ is p[articularly frightening, and has narrative significance. Regardless of how good those scenes were, removing them made for a much tighter movie. 

One of the problems with The Hobbit movies is that instead of cutting scenes to tighten the narrative, scenes were added. This compromises the narrative focus.


stardustsuperwizard,To be honest, I am re-reading lotr and I do not miss the Bombadil chapters, they slow everything right down and I don't feel that they add much in way of character or plot, it seems a strange stop of the story that goes on for way too long before it picks back up. The only real thing I can think of is showcasing Frodo's strength of character in the Barrow Downs scene.

Insanitarium,> The reason for that could be as simple as Tolkien not having decided that the Necromancer was actually Sauron when he wrote the Hobbit, but it seems more likely that he made a deliberate decision around that.

I agree with your general analysis, and think you make a good argument about Dol Goldur's place in the narrative of "The Hobbit"; I just want to clear up the ambiguity you introduce here.  When "The Hobbit" was written, Sauron's character was largely undefined, except for the fact that he was some ancient vampire/werewolf that had been lurking around Middle Earth since his defeat by Beren and Lúthien.  Tolkien already intended him, though, as some sort of Big Bad Evil Guy, and Gandalf's disappearance during Mirkwood seems to have been intended to suggest that there were threats in the light of which Smaug took a lower precedence, even if the specific character of Sauron and his relationship to the Ring were not yet a twinkle in the Professor's eye.

It is most likely that, when he was writing "The Hobbit," Tolkien hadn't gotten much farther in the idea that would become Sauron than "there's this powerful ancient evil wizard and he has truck with the dead."  *That being said*, Tolkien had definitely decided, during the writing of "The Hobbit," that the evil power Gandalf goes off to fight during the Mirkwood sequence was the great evil power he wanted as Middle Earth's antagonist, that the Council's defeat of the Necromancer was merely a temporary victory, and that this power had been a servant of Melkor during the mythic age of Middle Earth.  In the original manuscript, Bladorthin the wizard (aka Gandalf) tells Gandalf the dwarf (aka Thorin Oakenshield):

None,Hey, I was wondering where I can find these manuscripts? I'm a huge tolkein fan I have a pretty decent knowledge and understanding of the world, but I don't have enough knowledge about Tolkein's process and how Middle Earth has been changed in the Professor's mind through the years. 

Insanitarium,As far as actual "manuscripts" go, I can't help you-- they're in a variety of collections.  There are some really great curated editions that have been published which include Tolkien's process, though.  The section I quoted comes from "History of the Hobbit" by John D. Rateliff, and there's also the "[History of Middle Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Middle-earth)" series, which I finally got into in the past year or so, and which is fabulous. You get to see how the story evolved (Strider was originally a hobbit!  Gandalf was originally imprisoned by Treebeard!) as well as get some great outtakes (I love the alternate climactic scene at Mount Doom, where Sam ends up killing the Witch-King of Angmar by stabbing him in the back with Sting).

None,Thank you! I thought I wouldn't need "History of Middle Earth", because it seemed that every time someone referenced it I had gotten the same information from the Silmarillion.....but it seems that I was wrong! I'll have to read it asap! 

Insanitarium,Yeah, I thought the same thing for the longest time.  I was under the impression that HoME was an in-universe history of the legendarium, which honestly I had no interest in.  What it is, more, is about half otherwise-unpublished works, and about half guided tours through Tolkien's writing process, with Christopher working his way through each book and showing how the plot and characters emerged over various drafts and outlines.

As an example, the Mount Doom scene I described above, from a handwritten outline around the same time Tolkien started toying with the idea of Frodo succumbing to the Ring at last:

>Perhaps better would be to make Gollum repent in a way. He is utterly wretched, and commits suicide. Gollum has it, he cried. No one else shall have it. I will destroy you all. He leaps into crack. Fire goes mad. Frodo is like to be destroyed.  
>Nazgûl shape at the door. Frodo is caught in the fire-chamber and cannot get out!  
>Here we all end together, said the Ring Wraith.  
>Frodo is too weary and lifeless to say nay.  
>You first, said a voice, and Sam (with Sting?) stabs the Black Rider from behind.  
>Frodo and Sam escape and flee down mountain-side. But they could not escape the running molten lava. They see Eagles driving the Nazgûl. Eagles rescue them.


Insanitarium,Also, just in trying to remember whether Sauron's name had even been invented (in what would become the Silmarillion) by the time the Hobbit was written, I found this snippet from the Lay of Leithian through Google, which (a) I'd never seen before, (b) I love, and (c) explains finally why the "Necromancer" name made sense for the character:

>Men called him Thû, and as a god  
>in after days beneath his rod  
>bewildered bowed to him, and made  
>his ghastly temples in the shade.  
>Not yet by men enthralled adored,  
>now was he Morgoth's mightiest lord,  
>Master of Wolves, whose shivering howl  
>for ever echoed in the hills, and foul  
>enchantments and dark sigaldry  
>did weave and wield. In glamoury  
>that necromancer held his hosts  
>of phantoms and of wandering ghosts...

It's also more like Clark Ashton Smith than anything else I know from Tolkien, which is awesome in its own right.  Sumerian werewolves forever.

yrrosimyarin,This description of the Fellowship film is perfect. Aside from leaving out the Scouring of the Shire in Return of the King(which is, in my opinion, the most important chapter in the whole book from the perspective of theme), I don't have a single real complaint with what Jackson cut or combined in the trilogy. Every time he tried to add something new, though, he faltered.

abobtosis,The only part that pissed me off in RotK was in the extended edition.  When the ringwraith shattered Gandalf's Staff.  That should not have happened.

indierockclimber,I mostly agree, but some added scenes hurt The Two Towers I think. Aragorn's whole "near death" in the River? WHY?! or the Lorien Elves showing up at Helm's Deep? Why couldn't it have been The Grey Company or something? 

For the most part, I agree though. I like how Aragorn doesn't get Anduril until much later, or combining Glorfindel and Arwen in Fellowship. Just a handful of things in the trilogy bother me, as opposed to... entire swathes of the Hobbit movies.

jrf_1973,"the Lorien Elves showing up at Helm's Deep?"
They wanted Arwen to be a bigger part of the story (feminism or something) and so they wanted her to be at Helms Deep fighting alongside Aragorn. But she'd never make it to Helms Deep on her own. So she'd have an army escorting her.

But then they decided that Arwen being there was stupid. (Even though they shot scenes of her there, fighting.) And took her out. But left in the Elves.

The background materials on the DVD show each horrible mis-step in glorious detail.

yrrosimyarin,I may have been unclear, but I think in your first paragraph we are trying to say the same thing.

indierockclimber,You're right, we agreed, I think I had a reading comprehension fail :) I went off on a weird tangent, but I'll let it ride!

essen23,>or the Lorien Elves showing up at Helm's Deep?

I think this was done to show that the Elves have decided they have a stake in Middle Earth. I think it was a good idea. It was like a mini-last alliance (callback to the first movie) and the fact that Elves were departing Middle Earth so they had stopped giving a fuck.

gensolo,When the Extended Editions come out will you be doing a re-do?

TolkienEditor,If there's anything worth including, such as Thorin's burial or more Beorn shots, then yes I'll add them.

intraspeculator,You know it could be argued that, although he is in the book, Beorn adds very little to the story. I would say cut the whole sequence. 

thezlog,Cut him out from the battle of the 5, sure, but you don't mean entirely right?

intraspeculator,Yes I do. I don't see that he serves any narrative purpose. If he had done something of note in the final battle, maybe saving someone's life or killing a key villain then I would say keep him. As it stands the only thing he does is warn them that there are orcs around (duh) and warns them that mirkwood is a bit scary. If you cut him it would be a significant saving of screen time. I enjoyed him in the book but in retrospect I think it's fifteen minutes that could be saved for something else, like more smaug perhaps. 

pinkycatcher,I agree. If you can cut Bombadil from LotR then you can cut Beorn from Hobbit. They serve basically the same purpose.

ThePurpleParrots,I actually hadn't gotten around to reading The Hobbit before watching the movies, and it took me a long time to figure out he wasn't Tom Bombadil.  

Dr_Bobbington,> If he had done something of note in the final battle, maybe saving someone's life or killing a key villain then I would say keep him.

He does. In the book, it is Beorn who kills Bolg (who was also the only orc leader in the book), changing the tide of the battle.

intraspeculator,Yes exactly. It would have been significantly more meaningful for Beorn to kill Bolg, especially since its implied that Bolg killed his entire family. Instead Legolas does it... well, just because he was there. The 3rd film was  such a waste. It really felt like Jackson and co were just exhausted. Burned out on the series. Lacking in inspiration, or desire to smash it out of the park. The final battle felt like it was just done by the numbers. The Battle of Moira in Unexpected Journey was more epic than the battle of five armies.
Hell even Thorin fighting Azog in film one was more epic.

cptnflinty,I'll add to the chorus for the high res 6gb version please! Well done for putting the time and effort into this and thank you so much. I had one thought all the way through the last movie - "this shouldn't be its own movie".

TolkienEditor,I'm uploading it as we type. The link should be added to the site sometime tomorrow. However, I do want to temper people's expectations for the 6GB version. Considering the difference in size, the quality isn't *dramatically* better. It's somewhere between a DVD and Blu-ray. The screenshots above are a good indication.

That said, the image is sharper, and the colours are a little more vibrant, so it's probably preferable for people who'd like to watch the recut on a big-screen TV. Either way, it'll be there if people want it. :)

squaretie,What site?  I haven't watched any of the hobbit movies due to it being dragged out

And do you make cuts in the music so the cues are still in the appropriate places? If so, how do you prevent the musical tracks from becoming a jumbled mess? 

TolkienEditor,I tried to blend seperate musical cuts into each other (i.e. gradually lowering one's audio portion, while raising the others). Sometimes I would use an in-movie sound effects (such as an explosion) to mask the transition. There were several instances where I layered in music from the soundtrack to bridge two disparate scenes.

Naga-ette,After watching it, I agree with a LOT of the cuts, but there are two scenes you cut that I really feel need to be left in, if only for context and faithfulness.
First off, the scene where the dwarves sing while putting away dishes. YES it is a silly scene, but it's actually in the book! You can't call something a Tolkien edit and then take things out that were actually in the source material!
Secondly, the scene where they were rescued by the eagles is in the book, AND it sets up for later when the eagles come to help out in BoFA...

FezojT,Obviously I can't comment properly until I've seen the cut in its entirety, but thank you very much for doing this.

But I think what you've said summarises my main grievances with the Hobbit films. I've been vastly underwhelmed by all three, which is a shame; there is some real gold buried in there, it's just under a mountain of soulless filler. It makes me wonder, if Jackson had set out to do this properly (make a single film, do it really well and keep it in the spirit of the book), I could have another film to add to my list of favourites. I adore the book; it's one of my favourites from childhood, and I think Jackson has completely destroyed the character of it. It struck me during the latest installment that what I had essentially paid for was a martial arts/action film in a fantasy setting, and not the charm, world-building and Middle-Earth mythology that I had anticipated. 

I'll watch this with a clean conscience I think. I know a lot of people worked very hard for this, but I've paid inflated cinema prices to watch all three films, which is more than the trilogy deserves in my opinion. If it was any other story, I would have given up before reaching the third installment.

As for the Dol Guldur storyline, it is alluded to in the Hobbit (from what I can remember) and I think there is a place for it, but not as a full blown sub-plot. It did strike me as a bit silly that three or four lone figures would venture into a stronghold of evil only to partake in a gratuitous action sequence, the characters involved have no real connection to the story of The Hobbit itself and I don't really like the way characters like Radagast were portrayed. Personally, I'm glad you omitted this whole affair.

AquamanEatsSeafood,I made my own fan edit, clocking in at three and a half hours and it looks like we cut a lot of the same stuff.

Some different stuff I did:

I edited the barrel scene into a small montage, excluding the orcs (bolg is completely out of the movie), and ending with them arriving at the shore.

Smaug never attacks the dwarves, instead Bilbo puts on the ring, runs off, grabs the arkenstone, takes the ring off, and it cuts to him in another room with the banner collapsing over him, directly after the fight. Pretty nifty.

Beorn was also completely cut from the movie (being the tom bombadil of The Hobbit), and now everyone arrives at Mirkwood after the first film.


None,> Beorn was also completely cut from the movie (being the tom bombadil of The Hobbit), and now everyone arrives at Mirkwood after the first film.

How do you explain them arriving on ponies?

BigBennP,So I sat down and watched it last night. Overall it was pretty good. Much cleaner than the orignal. Only a couple parts really jumped out at me as being incongruous due to edits. 

1. Thorin and Co. are at the run-down shed (where the initially meet radagast), then suddenly walking through a canyon and coming on Rivendell and Thorin says to Gandalf "this was your plan all along wasn't it?"   What huh? 

2. I was actually a little surprised the rock giant scene remained.  

3. Thorin and Co. are facing a herd of wargs in the forest, then very suddenly are running out of the forest and into Bjorn's house, completely omitting the climbing the trees scene and the eagles.  Big disconnect, and while i kind of understand the choice, the Eagles are in the book and I missed them.  Also any mention of going to Bjorn's was cut in the jump. 

4. THe battle of 5 armies actually works better for a significant part, but there's a couple jump cuts that don't work well.  The scene where Thorin refuses to help Dain is cut, then Thorin has his conversion with no explanation, and Bilbo appears suddenly with his ring on for no apparent reason, and two different fight scenes between Thorin and Bolg are spliced together with Bolg suddenly having the big rock on a chain, but no clue how it happened. 

Bits of hte movie also sort of seemed to take on a feeling of "chapters,"  setting changed without much transition, and it jumped from one story bit to the next, but that's just a cost of cuts.   Overall I thought it told the story in a much cleaner way. 

AutoPsychotic,Agreed, rock giant scene could be cut entirely with no cost to the story whatsoever.

Ten-dollar-Ocean,Why did you cut the part where Bilbo says he cannot go on the adventure, after he asks if Gandalf can assure that he will come back and   Gandalf says something along the lines  of "No, and if you do you will not be the same".

JimmyJames137,Your continuity is bad in the Smaug attack sequence. Suddenly he's covered in gold? 

None,The Dwarfed edition did this scene pretty seamlessly, Smaug figures out Bilbo and the Dwarves got help from laketown and immediately flies towards it with not hints of any cat/mouse chase sequence.

Pinworm45,Watched that edit, it definitely makes the movie waaay better, but at the same time, the stupid dwarf fight with the dragon was one of the few sequences I actually enjoyed.. and people always go on about the CGI of the gold but IDK How they can do that literally an hour after all the orcs in the barrel seen. That was some nintendo 64 videogame shit.

elmonstro12345,As much as I though the leadup sequence to that was a bit over the top and dragged out, the final bit when Smaug bursts out of the gold and almost drags himself into the air while roaring "REVENGE??? I'LL SHOW *YOU* REVENGE" and then flying off towards Laketown shedding gold everywhere, and then cut to black, was one of the most epic scenes, and one of the best endings I have ever encountered in any movie, and I don't give a crap about the fact that it wasn't in the book. I was so pissed off that I had to wait a year for the final movie, but at the same time I had to admire the fact that there is no way they could have chosen a better spot to place a cliffhanger. That scene alone salvaged the entire movie in my mind (don't get me STARTED about the lameness of the scenes with Beorn). 

If it wasn't for the fact that all of the fanboys had already made up their minds to hate everything about that movie after the first one, no one would be complaining about that (except for a few minor and justified complaints about how long and zany the cat-and-mouse immediately before it was).

slayboo,This is a remarkable accomplishment. Well done, OP.

I fear though, that in compressing 8 hours of footage, mistakes inevitably occur. For example, removing the scene of molten gold covering Smaug, we are left confused as to why at the end of his attack on the dwarves, Smaug is seen removing gold from himself as he flies off. 

Perhaps if the Tolkein edit garners enough support, we can see a Peter Jackson, single-feature remake that gives us the smooth, hobbit-centered narrative OP strives to deliver - the one we deserve.

I'd rather they are just shown leaving in the barrels and arriving in Laketown in the next scene to be opened.

troubleonwheels,Just watched the whole thing.  Very well done.  Here are the only two comments I have:

- The handling of the white orc in the beginning of the film, in conjuntion with the bear/man is very spotty.  They escape from the goblins and Gandalf says 'run!', then all of a sudden they're at a house and a bear is attacking, then  there is the white orc talking for the first time.  It's pretty non-linear, and seeing as how the white orc plays such a big part later on it seems like 10 more minutes could have been spent here.

- The dwarves entry and exit from lake-town is way too cut down.  You get no sense that it's important at all and you have no idea why they're there.

I was thrilled to see parts of the extended versions of the first two movies I hadn't seen before.  All in all a well done cut!

aSc4rYGh0sT,Good stuff, but:

>Here are a couple of examples of recut scenes:

I think that it would have been even better if this was cut entirely. Rather than distracting, cartoonish action, the movie could jump directly from the Dwarves in barrels dropping into the river to the Dwarves on the edge of the lake.

Merad,So far I like it overall (bout halfway through) but I think the omission of the fight with the wargs that culminates in the eagle rescue is a poor choice.

Edit: Just finished.  My only other real complaint is that there are several awkward transitions (and I think maybe a continuity error or two) during the BOFA.

ajslater,I agree with the re-editor that Bilbo becoming suddenly aggressive is out of character.

TolkienEditor,Yeah, there are a bunch of problems with that whole sequence. Ultimately, it came down to creating a smooth transition between films, and the eagle rescue sapped any tension that was required of the opening sprint to Beorn's house.

However, the more I think about it, the more Bilbo's actions in the scene also irk me. What makes Bilbo a unique character is his *lack* of archetypal heroic characteristics. If this were any other story, we would follow the bold, burly Thorin Oakenshield. But Tolkien was much more interested in the timid, unassuming, sometimes cowardly hobbit.

Bilbo does find his courage throughout the story, but finds it using wit, resourcefulness, stealth, and compassion, rather than battle-prowess. Him sparing Gollum's life is so much more brave to me, than him slaying half a dozen orcs in the heat of battle.

To reiterate, it's not that I don't find it an entertaining scene (I do), I just don't think it fits with Bilbo's character arc.﻿

Merad,The thing is that it doesn't look like it's that hard to cut out the questionable material while retaining most of the spirit of the book.  This is the rough sequence of the end of An Unexpected Journey into Desolation of Smaug, ignoring the blatantly unrelated material (Smaug stirring and Thorin's flashback), with the strikeouts being what I would cut:

* An Unexpected Journey
  * Escape from Goblin Town
  * Bilbo rejoins the party
  * Chased by orcs and wargs
  * Trapped in the trees
  * ~~Azog taunts Thorin~~
  * Wargs attack the trees
  * Flaming pinecones
  * Tree collapses
  * ~~Thorin's suicide charge~~
  * ~~Bilbo tries to rescue, then protect Thorin~~
  * The other dwarves charge the wargs
  * Eagle rescue
  * Flight to the Carrock
  * ~~Gandalf revives Thorin~~
  * ~~Thorin apologizes to Bilbo~~
  * The eagles depart
  * Seeing the Lonely Mountain in the distance
  * The birds are returning to the mountain/a good omen
* Desolation of Smaug
  * ~~DoS title screen~~
  * Bilbo reports on the warg pack and Beorn
  * Gandalf introduces Beorn
  * Run to Beorn's house

It isn't perfect... I'd cut out everything related to Thorin being knocked unconscious, which means he won't be seen at all during the rescue, but oh well.

Even if you dislike what my suggestion above you really should try to improve what you have now.  There's a totally unexplained and rather confusing transition from "chased by wargs on the side of a mountain" to "running through fields from a bear thing".

Edit: Also, please lord I hope you cut out all of the Alfred scenes

None,Yup. It's out in Kickasstorrents.

-Strider,I've been thinking about this for ages and couldn't figure out how it was already torrented, and then it hit me. I assume it's because of its Oscar nomination?

myripyro,Yup, during Oscar season review copies get sent out - and they get leaked pretty regularly. They aren't always perfect, because the releases have to be carefully checked for watermarks - but they're not terrible.

None,There's an incredibly good version of it in Kickasstorrents.

Draugron,Which one? I've been looking for a good one for a while now 

None,I'm not sure if mods would appreciate me linking illegal torrents but you should find it pretty easily if you just look for the most popular one. It should have at least 700 comments and probably over hundred seeders and leechers. 

Chase_Meister,I hope I'm allowed to ask... but IF I were to torrent this, would I be risking any legal trouble or receive one of those nasty letters?  I don't torrent movies, but since there is no other way to watch this right now...

None,I have never recieved any letters. 

**However** I see couple of comments in KAT saying that they have recieved some warnings after downloading that torrent. Looks like that torrent is being tracked so I would be careful.

That being said, I have never heard that anyone has gotten anything worse than a warning letter. 

It's your call.

Uluithiad,Yes, please don't.

None,This isn't a complain against the edit/your work but I watched the edited Barrel Ride Sequence and I have seen it a couple times before but... since when did look so fake?  Is it just time or is there a source/editing reason because the cgi and possible different type of cam and footage just make it look bad (imo), and I never noticed this before.

Kastnerd,always looked fake. all 3d cgi and not filmed at the same time as the main part of the movie. 

Cutedge,I was thinking the same thing. I haven't rewatched Desolation of Smaug so I didn't remember if everything looked so CG or if it was  just how the footage was compressed. Maybe both?

PurplePonchoedPotato,No, it looked that bad in the original. Horribly obvious green screening and cgi

blekkja,The orc ten pin barrel bowling part is what brought me close to walking out. Please cut it. In fact that whole sequence. Have the Elves fire parting shots: fine. But the Orcs don't do anything for it.


Likewise the whole Dwarrow vs Dragon thing. Seems like you've got at least half an hour further easy cutting to go.

TolkienEditor,Dwarrow?

Edledhron,'Dwarrows' was the term that Tolkien felt should be the plural of 'dwarf' (as opposed to 'dwarves' or 'dwarfs'). It appears in an alternate name for Moria as 'Dwarrowdelf.'

eel_rahvey_waldo,Without a doubt, a flood of Hobbit re-edits are coming. As BOtFA becomes more available, surely hundreds of amateur cutters will have their own version, which they will add to a confounding BitTorrent clusterf*** and make it difficult to find a definitive professional cut. So, after reading what you have to say, maybe I'll just trust you, oh /u/TolkienEditor. The video will speak for itself, but you seem to have a really good grasp on what this should be.

What are the odds of a studio-sanctioned version being approved?

sailorgaia,I preface my comment by saying that "The Hobbit" is probably my favorite book.  It hasn't stopped being so since I first read it, some twenty years ago.  That being said, I actually enjoyed the three Hobbit films, with only one single complaint; the third felt too long with not enough substance--*just like everyone who knew the story expected it to be.*  I personally give Jackson some slack because IIRC, the original intention was for them to be a two movie deal that got dragged out into three either with the bouncing around between who would direct or the film's executives pushing to milk the product as much as possible (I suspect the latter).  

I look forward to checking out the edit because while I had a fabulous time watching Jackson's films, even with the fluff people seem to feel is so abhorrent, it'd be great fun to see it more condensed.

No promises, but I might be able to find a time to get subtitles synced up. Just a matter of getting the right FPS and changing the times (and I can do grammar at the same time).

CorwinB,Aargh! Damn you, I was part way through doing this myself. Looks like we were on similar lines anyway. 
I was also planning to bin off the stone giant fight sequence for being stupid (how does no one notice things this large?), boring and irrelevant.
Your cut down barrel sequence is good, personally I would have got rid of Bouncing Bombur as well as Spidergolas but it doesn't suffer much. The splashing gopro shots were unnecessary and jarred with the other footage though.

AlgernonBurns,thank you so much!!! such a relief to see most of the apocryphal material removed.  i would have liked the trolls cut out of tBoFA as well, but i am just so grateful those damn worms were removed.
shame it was impossible, but imo the slaying of smaug was the most absurd and cringeworthy scene - so cliche, unworkable, impossible and unnecessary!!!
thanks again!! I know this must have been a major undertaking, but do you intend to do the same when the final film is released so the quality is consistent throughout?

intraspeculator,It sounds like you've cut a lot of the best bits for the sake of making it more like the book. The prologue is wonderful. Dol Guldur was fantastic. I enjoyed the addition of Tauriel. I really like the fight sequence with Azog from film 1. I'm going to download and check it out. 

TolkienEditor,That's totally cool. I'm not trying to denigrate people who enjoy the trilogy in the slightest. My motivation was less about Tolkien puritanism, and more about returning Bilbo to the role of protagonist.

Those things you mentioned, regardless of how well or poorly they were executed, distract from that character arc, and that's why I didn't enjoy the movies as much as I enjoyed the book.

intraspeculator,Don't think for a minute I don't appreciate the effort and love you have clearly put in. 

Bearstew,More like the book, yes, but not just in the storyline sense. This edit seems to capture the essence of the book and the story better. I personally never hold a movie in poor regard for taking liberties with the plot or dialogue as long as it's done in a way to better translate the key concepts of the story to film. What I do have a problem with is movies using some of the inconsequential detail of a story and then missing the big picture (eg. I am legend). I think Jackson's Hobbit trilogy is also guilty of that. He wanted to do a Lord of the rings prequel, and used the Hobbit as a means to accomplish that. In so doing he lost the beauty of the Hobbit, and to me made the whole journey to the lonely mountain feel meaningless. How am I supposed to care about the dwarves trying to retake their homeland when they keep reminding me about how this is only a minor part of a much bigger problem.

I did love the Dol Guldur scenes but they subtract from the story of the Hobbit by up staging it.  The suggestions elsewhere in this thread that these scenes belong at Elrond's council fit much better to tie the movies together in my opinion.

intraspeculator,I think for me the biggest problem with the films (and the book for that matter) is the lack of development of the dwarves. They rarely disagree with each other. There's no drama within the group. It's a fundamental flaw in the story. You never get much of a sense of who they are, and so how am I supposed to care about them. 3 films should have been enough to flesh each of them out. Instead we got tons of cgi action, which I'm not against per se. I just feel that if the dwarves had been developed more, I would have cared more about them and consequently the fighting would have been more meaningful. I think perhaps that's why I think the addition of Tauriel was a smart move, and good story telling. When Fili and Kili died, it meant something. 

foul_ol_ron,If you bear in mind that the book was written for a young audience (From memory, I believe Tolkein suggested it being suitable for "an eight year old boy"- not sure his thoughts re girls and stories...). It was an extremely light tale for children, so I can understand the lack of angst in the original story. 

intraspeculator,True, but if that is the essence of the book, and if the film had reflected that, I think they would have been substantially less interesting than they are now. A truly faithful adaptation of the book would have probably only been suitable for 8 year old boys. If that. 

Bearstew,I always felt that the dwarves had that character in the book. It might have been far too long since I've read them though. I do remember the focus being much more on the Hobbit than the dwarves in the book too though. I guess my problem with the Tauriel addition is that I figure there were better ways to make Fili and Kili matter than adding new characters and large tangential story arcs. Give them more dialogue with Bilbo and build that relationship up instead. It seems much more in line with the theme of the book that it's Bilbo's story to me.

giant_red_lizard,It took me six months to push past the pointless hobbit hole nonsense of the first movie to see the whole thing. It was dwarves eating and burping and washing dishes... or something, I think I've blocked most of it out as a traumatic experience.

While Tauriel was honestly my favorite character of the trilogy. (Except in the barrel riding scene, where I really disliked everything past the initial escape and was just waiting for it to end.) She may not have been used very well, with the love triangle nonsense, but as a stand alone character she was much more entertaining than most.

You managed to preserve in the first, while removing the second.

How true it stays to the book makes no difference if you keep the worst part of the movies and remove one of the best parts to do it.

I'll gladly pass.

WinterDaHusky,In my opinion (which everyone is entitled to) it does make a difference. If you were the type (like me, and im sure many ither redditors here) who enjoys the book more than the movies, then this cut makes a huge difference and makes the films more enjoyable.

Cpt_Tsundere_Sharks,I would like to point out that you forgot to factor in the sustenance of *lembas* which they ate as they ran. Still impressive, but magical waybread baked by the Lady of Lorien and her maidens does help tremendously. 

>In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey. The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside, and inside was the colour of cream. Gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye. 

>'*Cram,*' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner and nibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish.

>'No more! No more!' cried the Elves laughing. 'You have eaten enough already for a long day's march.'

>'I thought it was only a kind of *cram*, such as the Dale-men make for journeys in the wild,' said the Dwarf. 

>'So it is,' they answered. 'But we call it *lembas* or waybread, and it is more strengthening than any food made by Men, and it is more pleasant then *cram* by all accounts.'

>'Indeed it is,' said Gimli. 'Why, it is better than the honey-cakes of the Beornings, and that is great praise, for the Beornings are the best bakers I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes to travelers in these days. You are kindly hosts!'

>'All the same we bid you spare the food,' they said. 'Eat a little at a time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many days if they are unbroken and left in there leave the cakes will keep sweet for many days if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will keep a traveler on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith.'

And later during the actual hunt, 

>Often in their hearts they thanked the Lady of Lorien for the gift of *lembas*, for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran.

Emphursis,That was definitely a factor, they had that to eat rather than having to stop and cook or go without. A 'real life' equivalent would probably be an energy gel.

Uluithiad,When figuring your times for sunset and sunrise, did you account for the differing calendar?

juicyj5977,Hmm, I didn't, but I might have lucked out? I think February 26th in the Gregorian calendar is February 26th by Shire reckoning. A good question would be was that a leap year or not?

http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/dates.html?dn=60

Uluithiad,February 26th in the Gregorian calendar is absolutely not February 26th in the Shire Reckoning. You're inputting the date in the adjusted box on the EoA's converter. You need to put it one that isn't adjusted. You'll then see the relevant events appear in the section underneath the conversion boxes, which should confirm that this was the right thing to do. February 26 SR is February 19 Gregorian.

juicyj5977,Mine eyes have been opened, thanks! I'll make the fix

rakino,So does that mean they actually had slightly less time to cover the 45 leagues?

Isn't the line of men that Aragorn is from supposed to be like, human at its peak or something? Like, Jack LaLanne in his prime would be something of a baseline level for these dudes, has always been my understanding.

 You say they were tracking as they went, but to be honest they were following an orc horde. That probably wouldn't be too difficult to track on the run.

Hydro033,It's actually pretty feasible for a regular distance runner. My regular weekly training in college would total ~40 miles in a 72 hour period when including my long run, and that's with classes and devoting <2hrs per run. Now, grant it, I would be carrying more shit, but I would also have all fucking day. The biggest issue would be food and water.

self_arrested,Just an FYI Aragorn whilst closer to human was stronger and had more stamina than any elf in Middle Earth the numenor were the combination of all the greatest qualities of men and elves physically but they aged. If any high elves were alive in middle earth from the origin of their kind however they would be stronger than the numenor, some such as Fingolfin were stronger than most maiar and Fingolfin was so powerful he could fight Morgoth (which means he was stronger even than Sauron the strongest of the maiar). However though Legolas may have been a high elf (I don't believe this was confirmed) his blood was not as strong as his father's or his father's before him. As I understand it Galadriel and Thranduil were the last elves to considered high elves in Middle Earth but neither were particularly powerful (Galadriel's power is totally overstated in the films, the fact she could control the ring had nothing to do with being powerful but rather than she was half the type of being that the ring was made for, only maiar and valar could weild the ring). 

Easy-A,>However though Legolas may have been a high elf (I don't believe this was confirmed) his blood was not as strong as his father's or his father's before him.

Legolas and Thranduil are not high elves, they are silvan elves. Neither of them ever went to Valinor. 

>Galadriel and Thranduil were the last elves to considered high elves in Middle Earth but neither were particularly powerful 

Why do you think this is true? While the whole battle in Gondor was happening Sauron tried to attack Lorien and Mirkwood from Dol Guldur. Once the elves fended off the attack the two elf armies led a counterattack and Galadriel personally threw down the walls of that fortress. By the time of LOTR Galadriel is one of the most powerful elves remaining in Middle Earth, being one of the very few left who had lived in the light of the Two Trees.

self_arrested,Not all of the high elves went to Valinor some remained most died they remained in the woodland realms having mixed with the other elves. Certainly all of the leaders of the high elves left but unnamed high elves remained.

While Galadriel is powerful she is not as powerful as she is presented in the films she could not stand against Sauron even if he was only in spirit if Gandalf and Saruman could not. That is my major objection here especially when it is explicitly stated that Gandalf was the most powerful being in LOTR.

Easy-A,> Not all of the high elves went to Valinor some remained most died they remained in the woodland realms having mixed with the other elves.

The definition of High Elf according to the Silmarillion is an elf who accepted the summons and went to Valinor. Elves that accepted the summons but stayed in Middle Earth are Grey Elves. 

self_arrested,Not according to the version I read as there was reference to high elves before that. High elves were those with the house of Finarfin the Noldor they were characterised by being particularly skilled and strong and the term high elf seems to have been similar to the distinciton between human an numenor. Perhaps this has been revised in more recent versions or maybe it's the other way around I don't know which revision my version of the silmarilion is.

WearMoreHats,From the Silmarillion's index:

> The Elves of Aman, and all Elves who ever dwelt in Aman, were called the High Elves (Tareldar) and Elves of the Light (Calaquendi)

self_arrested,Guess I was right our versions of the Silmarilion are different mine says the Noldor were the high elves as does some of the wikipedia pages. It appears that over revisions certain things have changed I presume the more modern versions were updated by Christopher Tolkein to remedie mistakes.

WearMoreHats,The Noldor are high elves - they traveled to Aman. I have a first edition of the Silmarilion and it says the same thing.

pikk,20 minutes/mile is exactly three miles an hour. That's average walking pace for an adult human. 

Admittedly, doing it with a pack and armor and a sword and shit makes it more difficult, but it's looking more like they were hiking, and less like they were jogging/running.  

tl;dr 135 miles in 72 hours is 1.8 miles an hour, equivalent to a toddler's walking speed.

SABLETROMBONE,I just want to point out that the humans of Tolkien's lore were better gifted than we are. Aragorn died at a little over 150 if I remember correctly.

CayceLoL,He wasn't "human", he was a Dunedain. Humans of Tolkien's lore are just as regular as we are. Like the citizens of Bree for example.

SABLETROMBONE,As was explained to me by practically everyone else. It's been 13 years since I read them.

pian0keys,Aragorn is also part elf, essentially. He was of the Dunedain, and was blessed with long life. There's a scene in Two Towers where he mentions to Eowyn that he's like 87 or something.

CayceLoL,He's not part elf, that's incorrect. Dunedain are a great race of men. They fought with the elves and were friends of the elves. They also shared some of the culture and language of the elves, but they weren't blood relatives.

pian0keys,Aragorn II's lineage actually can go back to Elros, who was a half-elf and brother of Elrond.  Technically, Elrond himself is only a half-elf unlike Galadriel and others, though, so the idea of what constitutes an elf is a bit muddled.  Granted, Aragorn's lineage takes twenty-three generations just to get down to Elendil and another forty generations to get to Aragon himself.  

So, for all intents and purposes, the humanity probably just bred the elf right out of Aragorn after 63 generations, but the fact that he's still technically (some tiny minute) portion of elf and that he was raised in Rivendell with Elrond makes me want to award him some kind of honorary doctorate in elf-dom. 

CayceLoL,You're right, there is that much elf blood in him.

Tolkien's half-elves sure are interesting. Elros chose mortality and I have always considered the choosing of your mortality the important part where they don't only choose for themselves, but define their lineage. That ability seems to vanish already in a couple of generations.

For example. I read that Aragorn's son Eldarion is considered a Dunedain, since Arwen chose mortality. Already Eldarion isn't able to choose and is considered to be part of the men. The choice is obviously a very physical thing since it makes you live or die. All this makes me think if the choosing already greatly dilutes the man or elf part in half-elves.

Anyway, fascinating stuff. Thanks for reminding me about the lineage trees, it's been a while.

pian0keys,Yeah, well there's just a teensy bit of Tolkien material. Lol.

Amishhellcat,he died at the tender age of 210, after 122 years of being king : o)

Wiles_,I always assumed he would pick a like minded successor. It's surprising how quickly they started shopping around after he retired.

rattatally,So who is the successor? The website list a few people as 'Director'. 

thornybacon,Taking a random guess I'd say his sons Simon or Adam Tolkien, the former is an occasional author himself, the latter has translated some of the books into French and I believe has assisted Christopher Tolkien with some of the editorial/promotional side of things in recent years.

cnzmur,Was it one of his sons that didn't talk to him? I have a vague memory of reading about someone with the Tolkien name who was a writer and got on very badly with his family. Might have been some other grandchild or something though.

PurelySC,It was Simon, but they've long since reconciled.

Billy_Fish,Simon is currently one of the directors while Adam is not.

thornybacon,Wouldn't he still count as co-writer of The Silmarillion etc under copyright law, they wouldn't be able to license the screen rights to those books without his permission?

ReinierPersoon,Perhaps they are using Appendices material instead? There is quite a bit in there as well. 

Leocletus,Generally speaking, one joint-author can authorize the creation of a derivative work over the objections of the others, though the others can of course demand an accounting and their portion of the proceeds.

Edit: [see](http://copyright.universityofcalifornia.edu/ownership/joint-works.html)

Wiles_,Do we know if any of that material is being used?

thornybacon,According to this article the current deal does not include The Silmarillion:

http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/lord-of-the-rings-tv-series-amazon-1202613609/





Cocospud,May be so but I think the article is just reflecting its interpretation of the press release wording, not responding to new info (there is none). It could be that the LOTR is being used as a branding name in the release. Who knows.

None,Thanks for crushing my dreams of a Silmarilion TV show. This is beyond a travesty! 

kingoflint282,NOOO. In a single post, you've crushed my hopes. Christopher Tolkien is not involved AND they don't have rights to the Silmarillion? That means they're gonna make shit up, which is bad. 

_18,I wonder if it will be related to the Second Age in any way or if it will take another crack at The Hobbit. I have a bad feeling about some adaptation of Akallabeth that will look like something out of Clash of the Titans.

thornybacon,To be fair, Christopher Tolkien himself is guilty of 'making shit up' to plug a couple of gaps in The Silmarillion, though unlike Peter Jackson he later expressed regrets about it...

HLtheWilkinson,What did Christopher Tolkien make up?

Evan_Th,The Fall of Doriath and Fall of Gondolin chapters, pretty much.  His father hadn't revised them for decades, so he had to rewrite them, make them consistent with everything else, and integrate in a large number of new concepts.

MechTheDane,So the Dwarven murder of Thingol and Melian peacing out to let everyone die?

Evan_Th,Yes - and then the first sack, Dior taking up the crown, and the Second Kinslaying.

setsuwa,The latter parts are from Tolkien. They appear in the Tale of Years (in HoME 11) but go back to the pre-LotR writings as well.

MechTheDane,So we don't know how Thingol dies or Dior dies in Tolkien's mind?

Evan_Th,No, not really.  We have the very earliest drafts in the Book of Lost Tales, but those don't align with a lot of Tolkien's later ideas from elsewhere - it's been a while since I read it, but back then Beren was an Elf, and IIRC the Girdle of Melian didn't exist.

(Also, back then, dragons were biomechanical inventions and killing a Balrog was nothing significant.  Dozens of them fell at the Fall of Gondolin.)

narf007,While this is true at least he drew upon his father's notes and at least had insight into his mind. This is a major factor that none of us, or anyone else, could ever have aside from Christopher himself.

If I want anyone making shit up regarding this legendarium it is Christopher and I think he has done an absolutely phenomenal job. I grew up with my father The Hobbit to me and by 5th grade I had purchased my very first Silmarillion. Paperback 2nd edition. My love for the Tolkien's work knows no bounds.

I hope he enjoys the rest of his twilight years. He has done so much for me without ever knowing I exist.

kingoflint282,I'll take Christopher Tolkien making stuff up over random show runners any day. He is the caretaker of his father's work and the reason that so much of it is published, he's earned the right to extrapolate a bit.

sakor88,I've understood that his father gave him full rights to edit, alter, add, remove or destroy any part of the entirety of his unpublished work.

thornybacon,I'm not particularly excited by this LOTR prequel series, even taking into account the Tolkien Estate's involvement, but as a fan of the novel I was bitterly dissapointed with The Hobbit films...this time round I think I've learned my lesson, and will try to separate my fondness of the source material from the TV series and try to judge (or hate) it on its own merits as a stand alone production, if it's terrible I'll just stop watching and pretend it never happened...the books will always be there unaltered, and at the very least it will be interesting to see a new production team interpret the writing...

TheShadowKick,> try to separate my fondness of the source material from the TV series and try to judge (or hate) it on its own merits as a stand alone production

That's my plan. I did the same thing with the LotR movies and the Hobbit movies. Just ignore all the similar nouns and enjoy it for what it is.

Cocospud,Why would Variety know more than other news outlets? A logical assumption on their part tis all.

magradhaid,Variety was the first to break the story about the deal in works before it became finalized, with anonymous sources in the industry tipping them off.

Cocospud,Ah, I wasn't aware who broke the story,  thanks for that. I thought they were simply relying on the press release like every other outlet.

imjustafangirl,Maybe they'll do a prequel series about Aragorn's adventures and origins. That could be okay. Born of Hope managed to fill and hour and a half on a fan budget and do it pretty damn well, so I can be optimistic. Right?

sebastianwillows,Inb4 whatever story they tell includes some shoehorned winks to the main series...

sakor88,> Christopher Tolkien is not involved

bad

>hey don't have rights to the Silmarillion

good

>they're gonna make shit up

bad

death_by_chocolate,It's as suspected: they're using the current New Line Cinema license from Zaentz for this and Christoper's properties are excluded from that. *Silmarillion* may come later down the road, but not yet. To be honest, they kinda *need* to use the old license if they're gonna pitch it for the money they're asking. The beancounters would have totally balked if you tried to sell them a "Tolkien" property that didn't include the characters and names already familiar--and the rights to use characters like Aragorn and Gandalf belong to Zaentz after all. Not sure how Christopher's resignation factors in. Seems like they could have done this either way, frankly.

I think you're just going to see a more liberal adaptation drawn from *The Lord of the Rings*, maybe using more material from the Appendixes, and if you were going to pitch one story it would be Aragorn's, in my opinion. He's the heir of the guy who cut the ring from Sauron's hand, he lived in Rivendell with Elrond and fell in love with Arwen, he hunted Gollum with Gandalf, he rode with the Rohirrim, he helped defeat Sauron and became King and married Arwen. What's not to like? You can fold in three or four principals from Jackson's films and tie them neatly into that story line, and your series is already a winner.

But everybody should keep in mind that the Estate--even without Christopher--is still involved and if the past is any indication they are generally fairly particular about the amount of leeway they will give on adaptations, and its not as if it's been handed over lock, stock and barrel to the TV guys--at least let's hope not.

None,My biggest concern is that the Estate won't be able to provide sufficient guidance on what is respectable of the source material and such.

I really, /really/ don't want to see "sexiness" get smeared all over the LotR like it is with Game of Thrones and other similar shows. Romance is one thing, but brothels and debauchery are not qualities of Tolkien's work and i'd hate to see it in adaptations. I'm just worried that's exactly what Amazon wants to drive viewership, though.

death_by_chocolate,Meh. Not a lot of sexytimes implicit in the text, unlike GRRM. Kinda think they won't use GOT as a model on this matter. You have Jackson's vision as it stands; why mess with success? I mean, in Martin's world there's an incestuous relationship that sits right at the heart of the tale. You couldn't tell that story without it. Nothing like that in Tolkien, although if you do tell the Tale of Aragorn and Arwen you might get some steamy clinches. But I think any attempt to inject raunchiness for the sake of ratings would be met on all sides with disdain. Why invite an uproar when you don't really need it?

VonDrakken,No incestuous relationship at the heart of Tolkien's work? Tell that to Túrin.

_18,Well he was cursed and they both killed themselves immediately after realizing what they had done. Incest isn't exactly central to the tale but it was what capped it off after a series of tragedies.

death_by_chocolate,Well. You won't be seeing any *Silmarillion* this time around. Maybe when HBO gets their hands on it we'll get some family fun.

yatea34,> It's as suspected: they're using the current New Line Cinema license from Zaentz

If anyone's unfamiliar, Zaentz is also [the guy who sued the singer John Fogerty for sounding too much like John Fogerty](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/11/artsfeatures3) because Zaentz owned some right to Fogerty's earlier works.

Wonder if those that took over [now that Zaents is gone](http://ultimateclassicrock.com/saul-zaentz-dead-john-fogerty-reaction/) will be better or worse.


death_by_chocolate,Well. By Zaentz I mean [Middle Earth Enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Enterprises), of course. M.E.E. was owned by Zaentz and the company still bears his name.

WikiTextBot,**Middle-earth Enterprises**

Middle-earth Enterprises, formerly known as Tolkien Enterprises, is a trading name for a division of The Saul Zaentz Company, located in Berkeley, California. The company owns the worldwide exclusive rights to certain elements of J. R. R. Tolkien's two most famous literary works: The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. These elements include the titles of the works, the names of characters contained within as well as the names of places, objects and events within them, and certain short phrases and sayings from the works.

MightyAdam,The Amazon lotr show makes sense now

thornybacon,I believe Christopher Tolkien was directly involved with the production of the 1981 BBC Radio adaptation of LOTR-as I understand it (I might be completely wrong), the Tolkien Estate currently retains the radio rights to the books and that production briefly included snippets from other books, so Christopher Tolkien must have approved the scripts...I wonder why he disproves of live action adaptations... 

Bufo1944,Co-adapter Brian Sibley sent the scripts to Christopher for approval. He was under no obligation to do so as the BBC had already leased the rights from the Saul Zaentz company. Christopher sent him an audio tape of him reading the correct pronunciation of all the names.

Christopher doesn't like adaptions unless they're entirely faithful to his father's writing. The BBC adaption was, PJ's adaption wasn't.

>The idea of doing The Lord of the Rings as a dramatized radio serial was the brain-child of Aubrey Singer, the Managing Director of Radio, and the fact that the child was successfully delivered was due almost entirely to Richard Imison, Head of the Drama Script Unit, who fought long and hard to secure the rights to the book and sufficient freedom for the adaptors to work without the intervention of American movie executives who believed they held a kind of sacred trust to ensure that the book wasn't mishandled! Amusingly, however, it was only when the negotiations were complete that it was discovered— to everyone's surprise and some people's embarrassment — that **the radio rights were not actually the property of Saul Zaentz at all, but were still owned by George Allen & Unwin!**

cloud_cleaver,They tend to change more, both by removing stuff and by adding their own OC or conflicting philosophical underpinnings. Radio seems like a more humble medium that strays less from the source.

piejesudomine,Also radio still allows for the imagination of the listener to take hold and doesn't dominate you with someone else's visuals

sakor88,> allows for the imagination of the listener to take hold and doesn't dominate you with someone else's visuals

Yeah... no goeiteia with flashy effects and domination of other minds.

cloud_cleaver,I'm really conflicted about this one. There are so many things I love about the casting and prop design from the Jackson films, but also so many things I dislike (especially where the elves are concerned). I had a bittersweet moment last time I read LOTR, realizing that since I'd seen the movies first I would never know what *my* version of Minas Tirith looked like, or what *my* understanding of Aragorn would lead me to believe his face looked like.

RuhWalde,>realizing that since I'd seen the movies first I would never know what my version of Minas Tirith looked like, or what my understanding of Aragorn would lead me to believe his face looked like.

That's actually why I was initially happy to hear there was going to be a new LOTR adaptation (before it became apparent it was going to be a prequel of some sort).  If there were more than one actor playing Aragorn, more than one screen version of Minas Tirith, then the Peter Jackson's versions wouldn't be so dominant in people's minds as THE definitive version.

I hope that if it is eventually adapted enough times, the characters will become more like mythic figures.  No one has ONE actor's face in mind when they imagine Robin Hood or Hercules, because they've been depicted so many different ways by so many different people.

cloud_cleaver,That's true, but I think it'll have to pass into public domain before there's a chance of that many adaptations running around.

Evolving_Dore,Very true, except that Hercules is Arnold and Robin Hood is a cartoon fox.

Nihil94,Pssh, I think you mean Kevin Costner.

With Star Wars Disney went in and changed the Canon with new works, deciding what does and doesn't "count" in the works themselves. Tolkien isn't like that.

shavarg0,copied from another post in the tolkien reddit:

bittersweet. christopher has done an amazing job all these years to pass on and protect his fathers work. pretty much every book after LOTR and the hobbit are because of him and for that, we fans should be extremely grateful.
BUUUUUTTTT
the same dedication also has been what's been holding back middle earth from the new generation. while i genuinely do understand the need to protect his fathers work from people just wanting to money grab off his name, he doing so hindered years of possbile adaptations that were made to his standard.
in total, props to the guy for his service but it was time for him to go. hope he lives to see the TV show and hopefully it makes him proud.

sakor88,> BUUUUUTTTT the same dedication also has been what's been holding back middle earth from the new generation. 

It hasn't been holding back. Middle-earth is right there, in the books. Not in adaptations.

shavarg0,in my personal experience it took the movies for me to learn of the books. i did not read as a hobby, i had no interest in reading at all, i just really really liked the movies and that led me to actually reading the books. 

thats what im saying. it is very possible there are people out there that the only way they would ever read the book is if there is an adaptation around their time. There are some people that just will never have that opportunity and i would hate for them to miss out.

NoMouseville,> i had no interest in reading at all, i just really really liked the movies and that led me to actually reading the books. 

I don't think that is true for as many 'kids' as you believe it to be. Pretty much all the youngsters in my family are voracious readers, their parents too. Maybe you come from an environment where reading isn't really a thing that's done, which if so I can see where you're coming from, but it's a pretty narrow perspective.

Tons of book series have been successful without a television or Hollywood adaption. The idea that literature requires a show or movie to 'make it' is pretty abhorrent. The reason LOTR had a movie trilogy made is *because it was already popular.* The same goes for Harry Potter, and A Song of Ice and Fire.  

AmishAvenger,I don’t think anything was holding it back from any sort of “new generation.”  Nothing’s stopping them from reading the books. 

shavarg0,and you really think your standard highschool kid is going to even know what lord of the rings is without a tv show? even the movies are starting to get to be too old for them. there is too much shit out there. without occasional updates and interpretations it could very easily get lost in the ether of fiction.

sierra-tinuviel,um...what? so many things wrong with that assumption..first of all, kids have parents. My parents showed me the LOTR movies for the first time and I loved them, immediately bought the books and became obsessed. second of all, "occasional" doesn't mean every ten years, that is *frequent*. I could see, maybe another 50 years from now remaking something but not 15. third, you don't need to continuously change something for it to be "relevant" *especially* if it's already damn near perfect in the first place. there are written works that are 2,000 years old and still wonderfully written and relevant works today. Why would you butcher a masterpiece to cater to short attention spans? Why wouldn't you, instead, use it to teach those same children how valuable and enjoyable works from the past can be? 

rainbowrobin,Your "standard" high school kid has never known what LotR is.  Fantasy is a niche interest, as is reading long books.  But a reader who is interested in fantasy?  If they talk to anyone else in the genre, or a librarian, yeah, they'll hear about Tolkien, same as they always have.

imjustafangirl,> standard highschool kid is going to even know what lord of the rings is without a tv show? 

I was in high school three years ago, shockingly we all knew what Lord of the Rings was. The movies were a decade old by the time I got to high school and guess what? People still watched them. 

shavarg0,My cousin is in 8th grade. I asked him and he had no clue. Look at that, anecdotal evidence.

imjustafangirl,then you better have some actual citations to statistical evidence that the average high school kid doesn't know what Lord of the Rings is without a TV show :)

kapparoth,Don't assume that kids are morons with an attention span of a goldfish. *The Lord of the Rings*, if you are not aware of it, has become a sleeper hit in the U.S., among roughly the same audience (high school/college kids) that at this time was supposedly losing interest in reading.

shavarg0,im a high school social studies teacher....

kapparoth,>  holding back middle earth from the new generation. 

Horsefeathers! Unless you assume that the new generation is not only functionally illiterate, but can't sit out a 2,5 hour movie, no one is holding back Middle-Earth. Why does everyone treat Middle-Earth as if it were a theme park or an open world video game?

shavarg0,what?

shavarg0,im saying that theres A LOT of shit out there. stuff from my childhood (90s) is already being lost in the shuffle. obviously LOTR is of higher importance than anything made during the 1990s but it is certain that if given enough time, even tolkien could become unknown. 

all im saying is im younger than most people on this reddit, and you know how i found middle earth? the movie. without seeing the movies theres fucking 0 percent chance im ever reading the books. and that could very well happen again with a kid seeing the upcoming TV show. i truly wish i understood why everyone on here is so negative and dismisive of adaptations. 

btw im student teaching high school social studies right now.... so i think i am decently qualified in informing about the intellectual capacity of the upcoming generation.

sakor88,> all im saying is im younger than most people on this reddit, and you know how i found middle earth? the movie. 

I saw Fellowship before I read the books. And yet I think that it would have been better if the Ring were never made. I mean the movies.

shavarg0,if the movies were not made there would be a fraction of the tolkien fans out there now. that isnt a bad thing unless you dont want people being in the fandom, which THAT is selfish. 

also i saw the movies first too..... why is that a problem?

chancetofreeze,You're probably in the wrong subreddit for this sort of mindset.

shavarg0,thats the first thing youve said tonight i think i agree with. i came to this sub to express my love for all of tolkiens writings and the future of middle earth but it seems all the other inhabitants just wanna talk shit about something they know almost nothing about and pretend that because they lived at a certain time a work of art belongs to them. its selfish, narrow minded thinking.

None,[deleted]

shavarg0,I really have nothing to say to you. 

sebus135,I don't get it either. I feel like having a lot of adaptations good and bad would be great. All adaptations would be open to criticism just as any other work. You can use the same way you discern between shit and good movies before you watch them with Tolkien adaptations. 

Nothing is lost Christopher is done with his father's work. You can only read those if you feel like they're the only stuff worthwhile. And a lot of people will be happy with some of the new stuff.
I love this sub they're well informed and cite text passages when they can but they're generally a bit snobbish I feel.

philthehippy,Overall I think you are wrong. Not attacking you, just stating how I feel toward your comments. What Christopher has done these last 44 years is nothing short of a masterpiece and there has been no disadvantage to how he has handled his Fathers work. The 12 volumes of HoME alone are worthy of being among the greatest literary criticism in the history of the English language.

You say that "all the other inhabitants just wanna talk shit about something they know almost nothing about and pretend that because they lived at a certain time a work of art belongs to them. its selfish, narrow minded thinking." but I have to say it is you who are being too broadminded expecting that Middle-earth has to become bigger than it is or have multiple adaptations, spin-offs and not what. Prof. Tolkien trusted his son, a man he watched grow into a very decent writer from a boy listening to his stories and catching him out when a colour changed on the Polar bears tie or a detail about Hobbits when his father was flying blind making up stories for his young boys was wrong. This relationship goes beyond money or sales, it bridges a gap between us and Tolkien himself. Christopher is that bridge, he understands the writing in a way that most of us only dream. It is deep and spiritual and the notion that he has held this magical world back is frankly laughable.

I have no doubt that like you, many people found their way to Middle-earth through the eyes and creativity of Peter Jackson but for many others of us this is not a movie, a TV series or some hip thing that will be replaced next week by the next 'in thing' that is being Tweeted about (I am not suggesting that is you). To me and many others this world and the Tolkien's are a treasure and we have stood beside him and supported Christopher Tolkien in his stance over the years because we don't want to see Middle-earth 2.0 or gambling machines (WARNER) or GoT style TV which is now a very likely prospect. We are reeling from this and November 2017 has been a whirlwind.

shavarg0,Idk how this all got so heated but you're free to have your opinion. I'm just of the opinion adaptations are necessary and I'm excited for the tv show. Good debate :)

Durendal_et_Joyeuse,There have already been six movies that have done the job of introducing Tolkien to “a new generation.” At this point, if anyone wants to explore more of Tolkien’s works, they can get the books.

shavarg0,that was 2001 dawg. that generation is all grown up.

Durendal_et_Joyeuse,I’m not sure what your point is. Are you saying that we need to market Tolkien’s works constantly to make sure it’s fresh for every single generation? Is the most important thing to you to make sure Tolkien is always recognizable and relavent? 

Essentially you want to turn Tolkien into a brand. 

Tolkien isn’t Star Wars. Tolkien is literature. We should be exposing “new generations” to his works by elevating readers, not appealing to the lowest common denominator.

shavarg0,theres technically right, and then theres practically right. technically you are right. we should encourage reading more. 

but youre so fucking technically wrong. it will NEVER happen. kids dont read anymore. so we have to do things that will actually work.

and if you wanna be a selfish book nerd you can be but i want future generations to fall in love with middle earth like i did. and im not saying EVERY generation needs something but there is plenty of story left to be made.

TheShadowKick,They've been saying kids don't read anymore since I was a kid way back in the 90s. Probably longer.

shavarg0,in the 90s you didnt have a piece of plastic in your pocket that had the entire sum of knowledge ever compiled by humans. 

TheShadowKick,And now I read books on one of those pieces of plastic.

shavarg0,and kids dont. they text, youtube, play games, watch the very show im talking about. maybe some of those kids that wouldnt have read the books get inspired from the show.  thats what im saying that COULD happen if they keep updating it. and im not so delusional as to think that adaptations will in any way hurt the books so there really isnt any downside.

Sinhika,Sure, kids don't read. That's why Harry Potter was an epic best-selling children's book series--because it was being bought by the millions for people who didn't read it. Lather, rinse & repeat with any other hugely popular YA series in recent years: Hunger Games, Percy Jackson, etc.

Durendal_et_Joyeuse,If you think the best way of getting kids to read is by constantly creating new film versions of literature for them, then I suggest you stay as far away from pedagogy as humanly possible, especially if you think that my perspective makes me a “selfish book nerd.”

shavarg0,i read every single piece of Tolkien after seeing the movies..... and you do know they show movies in literature classes? like you are so far off base man i hope you stop living in the past.

Durendal_et_Joyeuse,I never said showing movies was an ineffective way of getting young people to read. I was suggesting that it does not need to be our first or primary solution. This really should not be so difficult for you to follow.

shavarg0,i never once ever said that it was our first primary solution.  idk why its so hard to read what im saying instead of putting words in my mouth

Pluvialis,Anyone want to explain why Tolkien's works shouldn't just be public domain now? I mean, in terms of what's best for creative endeavour and public enjoyment of it. And by extension I'm also talking about any similar literary work.

-hh,In simplest terms, "Copyright Law".

Simplified, the current (USA) copyright law is {Year of Publication} + 95 years.

For the Hobbit, 1937 + 95 = 2032
And LOTR, 1954+ 95 = 2049

However ... ever seeing dates aren't likely IMO, as the recent history of copyright law is that wealthy corporate Special Interests (ie corporations who own IP such as Disney, record labels, etc) "convince" the politicians to have them change the law to lengthen the term.  The recent US history has been bills with +20 year extensions which  have happened every ~20 years (1976 & 1998).

Now because 1998+20 years = 2018, I'd say that we're about due "any time now" for there to be a yet another bill for yet another +20 year extension to be pushed through Congress.

---------------

TL;DR summary:  the underlying intent of copyright laws has been corrupted by corporate interests, and if they have their way, no works will ever 'expire' out ever again.  This would mean that pragmatically, the only way that any reasonably recent copyrighted work will ever pass into Public Domain is if the Copyright Owner explicitly chooses to *release* it.



Sinhika,That's only true for *rights* owned outright by corporations, which, outside of the corrupt and predatory music industry, is only true for works created by those corporations, like movies and TV shows. Authors normally *license* their rights for a limited period of time, but keep ownership of the copyright. 

Unless they've changed things lately, individually-owned copyrights currently have a duration of {life of the author} + 70 years. Tolkien died in 1973. Do the math.

-hh,True, there is a difference between "works for hire" for which the "Life of the Author plus XX" can apply, but there's also special rules for works published before 1978, so just which set of rules actually applies to what can get messy.  

In any event, my basic point still holds, namely that updated laws have changed the "expiration" date to be later and later and later.  

For example, ignoring works for hire and other provisions to focus primarily on where the "Life of the Author" provision would apply, the simplified history is:

* 1790 --> 14 years from publication with option to renew for +14 years = max 28 years

* 1831 --> 28 years from publication +28 year renew option = max 56 years

* 1976 --> Life of Author + 50 years (didn't exist before 1976)

* 1998 --> Life of Author + 70 years







kapparoth,Someone has explained to me that it's all tied to *Steamboat Willie* (feat. Mickey Mouse). As soon as it's about to pass into the public domain, the Disney lobbying machine gets revved up and gets the copyright terms extension. As things stand now, it might hit the public domain in 2023, so you're not too far off the mark in your calculations.

-hh,Yes, I've heard the "Steamboat Willie" story as well.   

Given the current political climate in DC, I'd not be surprised to see a bill on this much sooner than later (triple Republican control), which means prior to the November 2018 elections (or in the lame duck session immediately after, but prior to the 2019 Congress start)

rattatally,Not sure how I feel about this. Tolkien's material is difficult to adapt. Even Peter Jackson's movies were a unique combination of the right cast, Weta Workshop, Howard Shore's music... they managed to catch lightning in a bottle.

I hope Amazon puts some talented people behind it who are also able to stay true to the source material. But  the fact that they have already a spin-off planned seems like they're thinking more about the franchise than the story.





lordberric,The only way I'd really want this is if it was set in PJs Middle Earth, and it'd have to be a prequel to the trilogy. But who could possibly fill the roles of Gandalf, or Aragorn?

FrogusTheDogus,I 100% agree with you. For all their inaccuracies, the PJ movies captured the magic of the stories with a fantastic team, everywhere from wardrobe to music.

I just can't help but wonder what the story will be...  I've heard anything from the appendices seems in-bounds, but that still feels a bit small of a source to develop into an entire TV series. My biggest fear is everyone is hopped up on GoT obsession and they're looking to develop something similar out of Tolkien's works. I shudder at the thought! 

sakor88,> PJ movies captured the magic of the stories

That was somewhat true on Fellowship. But saying that it is correct in any other of the movies is stretching it in my honest opinion.

andipandi9,Exactly all of the above. I want these to be amazing but I question the true intent that's motivating this.

David_the_Wanderer,What I'm wondering is "how?". In the past, Christopher Tolkien has been very open of his disapproval on any adaptation of his father's works, no matter the quality, so how comes the Estate has agreed to this? Does anyone have info?

lordvaryous,Can you link something where Christopher critics the movies ?

David_the_Wanderer,In an interview with the French newspaper *Le Monde*, Christopher stated that "they eviscerated the book by making it an action movie for young people aged 15 to 25" and "Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed into the absurdity of our time"

Source: http://www.indiewire.com/2013/01/christopher-tolkien-trashes-peter-jacksons-lord-of-the-rings-says-films-lack-beauty-and-seriousness-of-the-books-102485/amp/

Interestingly, though, Christopher's views on adaptations of his father's works seem to be much more rigid than those of J. R. R. himself had been: http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2013/06/03/72359-what-would-the-professor-have-thought-of-peter-jacksons-version-of-the-lord-of-the-rings/

However, I think I understand where Christopher is coming from. As long as Tolkien was alive, he could exercise the power of "authorial veto" on movie adaptations, ensuring that the changes made to the story would fit with the story and wouldn't alter the narrative and underlying themes of his novel. Now that the Good Professor is dead and his opinion can no longer be heard, Christopher has taken to protecting and preserving Tolkien's works as best as he can. I think I would do pretty much the same if I were in Christopher's shoes.

_18,>"they eviscerated the book by making it an action movie for young people aged 15 to 25" and "Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed into the absurdity of our time"

In a way I agree with him. The Fellowship of the Ring is my favorite of the three movies and it's the only one that doesn't melt my brain from the violence that just drags on for a huge amount of screentime. I don't think I've ever been able to watch The Two Towers or Return of the King in one day. The extended editions didn't add anything I liked either from what I remember.

Picklesadog,I think a lot of the scenes in the extended editions only make it worse...

That drinking contest between Gimli and Legolas might be the worst Peter Jackson scene from any of the Tolkien adaptations. 

kapparoth,A drinking contest? Thank goodness I have managed to block out that scene.

sakor88,Even some of the stuff in the Fellowship that was in the extended editions was just ... dumb. Good thing they were not in the theatrical.

None,[deleted]

sakor88,Exactly. I wonder why some people go through the trouble of saying that "it is impossible to put everything important from the books to the films", when PJ used so much screentime on nonsense.

Evan_Th,>when PJ used so much screentime on nonsense.

If you need more screentime, you could just cut the Battle of Helm's Deep, like Tolkien himself suggested. *grumble grumble*

sakor88,>you could just cut the Battle of Helm's Deep

Or cut one third or half of it away. And cut away the warg attack and entire scene where Aragorn falls of the cliff, floats on the river, has hallucinations and makes out with the horse etc.

freyalorelei,*coughTheHobbitmoviescough*

Picklesadog,Nope, even worse than that.

At least the other shit scenes have a semi understandable reason... 

The drinking contest was simultaneously shitting on Gimli as a character, while also absolutely breaking lore by making Elves immune to alcohol.

I think the main problem was that Peter Jackson was NOT a Tolkien fan. He had read the books once in high school, and I'm not saying he didn't like the books, but he was far more interested in telling Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings than Tolkien's.

iphoton,Say what you want about Peter Jackson and his poor choices but you're high if you think he wasn't a fan. If there is anything you get from watching all the behind the scenes extras it's that he and his crew worship Tolkien and had the books on hand at all times. Did they make changes? Yes. Did they add some stupid shit? Yes. But they stayed true to the themes of the story and kept most of the best lines from the book untouched. 

Picklesadog,When I say he wasn't a fan, I don't mean he didn't enjoy them, I meant he had just read the books casually as a teenager and never picked them up again until he got the job to make the movies.

To me, that isn't a fan anymore than a sports fan who only watches their team in the championship game is a fan. 

To say Jackson "worshipped Tolkien" is absolutely BEYOND absurd. Literally everyone on this sub had read more Tolkien than Peter Jackson before he got the job. 

iphoton,This is exactly what I had a problem with. Peter Jackson didn't just "get the job." He and his wife and one friend wrote the script on their own because they were huge fans of the book and then went from studio to studio until newline gave them the funding to make 3 films.

Picklesadog,A huge fan of the book doesn't just read it once in high school. 

He specifically mentions that in an interview.

iphoton,No he doesn't. He says he read it for the FIRST TIME in high school. Then he talks affectionately about his first copy of the book and how he still keeps it around. I've seen that documentary a million times dude. They started it as a goddamn passion project. If you wanna argue against the quality of the movies or the quality of him as a director fine but don't try to argue about objective facts.

Picklesadog,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)#Development

Sure as hell doesn't sound like it to me. 

Also, I am not sure how you can claim that he was a huge Tolkien fan when so much of his movies broke lore or just ignored important aspects of the story. The movies come off very much like Peter Jackson thought he could create a better version of Tolkien's works.

iphoton,We can argue all day about the changes made and how they do or don't stay true to themes of Tolkien's work but I won't entertain it because it's a distraction from our actual argument. Did you even read that link you posted? I must have missed the part were he read the book one time. I feel like you just want that to be true so badly that you'll read into anything that could possibly be misinterpreted as that. You're hardly being objective. He wrote the screenplay! Do you understand how much knowledge of the book you have to have and how many times you have to flip through each chapter to convert a book to a screenplay. It also says they brought on Phillipa. You clearly don't understand how much of a diehard she is. She would fit right in with the purists here and she was a primary contributer. I'm done participating in this dick measuring contest though. I award you one gold star for being a bigger fan than Peter Jackson. For anyone else who thinks the people who wrote the script just did it because they got the job and didn't really appreciate the work of Tolkien watch this

 https://youtu.be/U51G9VJ4zZY


Picklesadog,Its almost like you didn't even read any of my comments. 

He had said in an interview that before getting the chance to make the movie, he had read the books once in high school. Obviously he had to reread them, but my point is he wasn't what we would consider a Tolkien fan, and this is obvious in some of the character and story changes he went with in the movies.

sakor88,> But they stayed true to the themes of the story

https://phuulishfellow.wordpress.com/2017/01/27/on-war-tolkien-vs-jackson/

NoMouseville,In what way was making Aragorn the reluctant ruler a part of the theme of the story? 

That alone made the Jackson trilogy unwatchable for me. 

Imladris18,It made the whole trilogy unwatchable because of that? Holy pedantry.

NoMouseville,It completely flipped his entire character. I'm not being a pedant, if you enjoy it go right ahead and watch it as many times as you want, but let's not pretend it was true to the source, because it wasn't. 

Thanks for the condescension though. I'm sure it made you feel better about your own feelings on the Jackson trilogy.

Imladris18,It's not about my own feelings on the trilogy or being condescending. Your finding it unwatchable does not affect my enjoyment of the films. It just seems a bit much that one detail rendered the whole thing literally unwatchable for you, and it's a bummer that you can't enjoy all the great stuff in the films because of it.

NoMouseville,Not really a bummer for me, they've been out for a long time and I don't feel like I've missed anything. There's plenty of other reasons for my dislike of the movies, but if it were just that reason it would be enough. They just don't correspond to what I got out of the source, and in some cases miss the point so much that I can't just ignore it.

But no, it's not a bummer that I don't like them, no more than it's a bummer that I don't like artichokes. It's a bummer (for me) that I didn't get what I wanted, sure, but there's been plenty of time to make peace with that. What I wanted probably wouldn't have made a successful franchise.

freyalorelei,*The Hobbit* was worse because instead of a few questionable scenes that disregarded lore in what was otherwise a solid film, and only added after the theatrical release, we got three whole movies with barely a shred of redeeming value (I say barely only because I believe Martin Freeman's performance was the lone highlight of the films. Everything else was execrable). I can ignore some of the shaky moments in the *LotR* films because of how enjoyable they are as a whole; I can't ignore three whole films of unrelenting drivel.

Picklesadog,I still think the drinking scene was worse.

I totally agree with you on how bad the Hobbit films were, but the drinking contest scene was just godawful. I think it stands out more because the LoTR movies were pretty damned good, even if they weren't exactly true to the book, which makes this scene all the more horrible to watch.

Martin Freeman was fantastic, and I did like Benedict Cumberbuns voice as Smaug. The "Riddles in the Dark" scene was pretty good, too. 

_18,I just refuse to believe you think that one drinking scene is worse than every scene in the Hobbit adaptations. What do you even mean that you find it worse? You'd rather watch the entirety of the Hobbit trilogy than the Return of the King if it contains that scene?

Picklesadog,I didn't say anything like that, just that I think that particular scene is the worst scene in any of Peter Jackson's adaptations. 

freyalorelei,Worse than Albert cross-dressing? Than dwarves in a toilet? Than the painful elf/dwarf love triangle? Than Radagast's poop-hat? Than Bilbo Baggins: Action Hero? There were so, so many terrible moments in the *Hobbit* movies that it's more expedient to just write them off entirely.

As for positives...Riddles in the Dark was indeed solid, I liked the addition of Galadriel and the Council of the Wise, and Thranduil was smokin' fine. Otherwise...bleh.

Picklesadog,Like I said, a horrible scene in a good movie stands out far more than a horrible scene in a bad movie. 

The contrast is what made it worse, in my opinion.

sakor88,Remember the elven "healing" scene that we were "privileged" to see (wording of one of the dwarves).

freyalorelei,That falls under the love triangle nonsense for me.

The sad thing is, I wouldn't have minded *the idea* of Tauriel--a female elf guard with a few lines of dialogue who plays a small role in assisting Bilbo et al in Mirkwood. That's fine. Including any sort of romance, let alone making it a focal plotline? Nope, I'm out.

TiboAS,Soundtrack, scenery, scenes like Riddles in the dark, Smaug? Martin Freeman was not the lone highlight 

freyalorelei,The first couple songs were good. New Zealand is always pretty--it's hard to mess up cinematography when you shoot in the most photogenic country on the planet. Riddles in the Dark I mentioned later was mostly on point (thank goodness they didn't screw up THAT). Smaug was decent, although I wasn't as impressed by him as most people seemed to be. And, speaking as a lady into dudes, Thranduil was very nice eye candy.

The first movie in general was decentish--some highs, some lows, a lot of in between. The next two were just garbage.

kapparoth,*The Hobbit* was worse because the movie direction pretended that the original work is similar to *The Lord of the Rings* - or to be more precise, a certain idea of *The Lord of the Rings* -, which it isn't.

freyalorelei,Dementia? Hypnosis? Massive head trauma?

Seriously, I can't think of anything that would make Christopher Tolkien sign off on a movie deal. He strongly disliked the *LotR* movies, and you'd think that the *Hobbit* atrocities would be the nail in the coffin.

EDIT: Now I'm picturing that scene in the *Two Towers* EE where Grima gets a doddering Theoden to sign off on the banishment order for Eomer. Is that what happened here? Is Christopher Tolkien losing his faculties, to the point where he'll sign anything in front of him?

Fishb20,I think he realized that someone eventually would try to make a lotr extended universe, and decided that because it was bound to happen eventually (the shadow of series was probably supposed to be the spear head of this), the best person to lead it would be him

freyalorelei,Maybe. Even so, this seems out of character for him. I'm kinda worried for his physical and mental well-being. :(

Fishb20,me too

I'm trying to stay positive, but I worry this may be a harper lee-esque situation

akili_kuwale,Christopher is a very old man now. Maybe he's no longer in charge of the Estate, and it's his successor who's doing this.

David_the_Wanderer,Wouldn't the Estate/Christopher make a public announcement if that happened, though?

magradhaid,Apparently not; Christopher resigned effective August 31st and there was no announcement.

David_the_Wanderer,Oh. Well, that answers my question.

I'm kinda bummed, though. The Estate had been Christopher's life, and it saddens me to learn he is no longer part of it.

VonDrakken,Maybe not. If the perception is that Christopher is still running things, that puts the estate in a position to drive up the asking price (given Christopher's dislike of the films). If it's clear that film-friendly family members are running the estate, wouldn't that put Amazon et al., in a better bargaining position?

I_Am_A_Doombot_AMA,But the Estate was shopping around for someone who wanted the rights, that would already make it clear that they're willing to deal.

rockyrainy,> It's important to note that this series "will explore new storylines preceding J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring," rather than re-tell the stories depicted onscreen in Peter Jackson's trilogy. The deal, which commits to multiple seasons for the show, also includes a possible spin-off series. 

Silmarillion does have a lot of content for a multi season show + spin offs.

rattatally,I doubt it. They don't have the rights for that. If the Estate had sold them it would be news itself. 

FuckDurgesh,Shadow of War, the Amazon prime exclusive show!

Looks like the Tolkien Estate and Trust is involved or at least endorsing this. Do you think this is partially the result of the recent settlement (July 2017) with Middle Earth Enterprises? Hard to see this getting the greenlight so soon after if it wasn't a thing that was explicitly included in the settlement. 

SageRiBardan,According to Deadline and a few other sources the estate shopped this to Amazon, Netflix, and HBO. Amazon was willing to pay the most for the rights. It's an odd partnership of the Estate, the publisher, and New Line Cinema who approached the streaming companies. Hope since the estate is involved we will get some new material on film that is lore appropriate.

j3ddy_l33,It’ll probably suck, but whatever, I’m always willing to give good creative projects a chance. I play tons of RPGs and board games set in Middle Earth that tells tales outside of existing canon, and more often than not I think it’s fun to imagine what else could be going on in the world. At worst, it will in no way impact my ability to enjoy Tolkien’s writing, at best, I’ll have a great new show to watch that encourages new people to check out a world I love. 

Gandalf-the-Goat,I agree, I used to be a stickler about how accurate everything is instead of actually just liking something for what it is. I'd rather have people keep trying to expand it and have a few flops then have nothing at all. There's no more Tolkien material coming out so I welcome the expansion of middle earth in this format. If it sucks then I'll just write it off and that'll be it, doesn't stop me from enjoying the content in the books.

othellothewise,I dunno, I like the books for what they were and I'm always fine with movie adaptations. But I've always found it weird to write new stories for a specific author's universe. Oftentimes the person writing these stories doesn't understand the themes of the original work or the vision of the author.

The only time I've seen it work out is in the Wheel of Time series with Brandon Sanderson finishing Jordan's work. But that was a special case since Jordan had a *ton* of notes and Sanderson is a brilliant author.

Sinhika,Frankly, Sanderson improved on Jordan. The Aes Sedai heroines suddenly turned from unpleasant harpies to strong, competent women.

kapparoth,It was hard *not* to improve on the latest *Wheel of Time* books written by the man himself.

It goes without saying that nothing in Tolkien's work warrants that kind of treatment.

othellothewise,I agree and think he's a better writer from that point of view. Jordan's work is still incredibly impressive with the universe he created.

Braatha,A TV show set at the end of the third age? Oh god... 
I have a bad feeling about this. 

There are no source material to pull from on this one, meaning their gonna go off the fucking rails. They could have chosen to do anything, how about series that follows the blue wizards then they go east? That could be interesting... 

I have feeling we are going to see a lot of things that are out of place and do not belong on middle earth. If shadow of War was able to make a "Orc necromancer" who could restore the souls of fallen Maiar... oh god. please no.

**Edit: I misread the article, it states BEFORE the fellowship.**

klykken,I mentioned similar points about the blue wizards last week and was downvoted. 

Dark_Lord_Melkor101,They did not say set at the end of the third age, they said "set before the events of The Fellowship of the Ring" - I'm cautiously optimistic. 

I disagree with you on your claim there is no source material- for western Middle Earth at least, almost every notable event has been carefully described to fit with the lore, either by Tolkein himself or his son. Concerning your proposal about the Blue Wizards, I would find this interesting, although this in of itself has not been documented, perhaps on purpose, this would allow the writers to be more creative rather than sticking religiously to the lore.

I agree with you that where it is possible to be canon, they should make it so. I loved Shadow of Mordor as a game, yet from a lore perspective it was a train wreck.

In summary, if they're going to base it one Tolkein's work (i.e. something he's written about), they should stick with the lore as if retelling a story. But should they choose to cover something completely undocumented, which I would be more interested in, they have the freedom to create their own story, and could prove very successful, provided it is canon where it needs to be. 

Braatha,Oh man, I misread that article then. I believed it said "after the fellowship of the ring". 

Are we to assume this takes place after Gil-galad had died? 
I would be delighted to see the portrayal of the "fairest and wisest elf". 

Note that I would welcome new ideas, that could potentially become cannon, however I would like to see them handle something written before they get the go ahead to create what they please. A good example would be Game Of Thrones Season 7. After they ran out of source material they wrote their own, and although it was good, it was not what we enjoyed about the series. 

AmandaHuggenkiss,We all know fine well what you enjoyed about the series...

CptAustus,Hey, Sil happened before the events of Fellowship. Feanor hype.

phonylady,I don't think they have the rights to anything outside of Lord of the Rings (with appendices) and The Hobbit though?

iheartdev247,Who knows, Tolkien Estate as in Christopher has signed off on this, maybe other rights are in play.

Braatha,True statement. 

**FEANOR** intensifies. 

Seriously though, I would appreciate series set following the plot of "Children of Hurin" That is a fantastic tragedy and fit for Television. 

Kattzalos,I mean, they already did incest in another popular fantasy series, so I can't see why they wouldn't greenlight it

IThinkTheClockIsSlow,Not enough info yet to make me cringe in fear.  However, I am not hopeful given how badly the Dark Tower was done and now that Dune is being made with Herbert's son's involvement.  The only fitting word is Abomination. 

Jackson's LOTR has set a very high bar for book adaptions.  Warts and all it is the current gold standard.  Would love to see something remotely close.

David_the_Wanderer,What does the Dark Tower movie have to do with this? None of the people involved in that project have anything to do with this.

Also, I thought getting Herbert's son involved with the making of Dune was a *good* thing...?

IThinkTheClockIsSlow,> What does the Dark Tower movie have to do with this?

A beloved book being turned into a steaming pile of shit.  Don't want that for Tolkien works.

David_the_Wanderer,But, as I said, none of the people involved in the Dark Tower movie are involved in this project. It makes no sense to say that since Dark Tower was awful, this TV series runs the risk to be awful as well.

Also, I see your Dark Tower and rise my IT (2017). That was a pretty good movie which, in my opinion, managed to capture the feeling of the book while not remaining 100% faithful.

Which is an important thing to remember: a good adaptation isn't necessarily a faithful one. Since we're in the realm of Stephen King's works, just watch Kubrick's *Shining*: there are enormous differences between it and the book - yet Kubrick's movie is regarded as a great movie and an hallmark of the history of cinematography.

Also, the Dark Tower tried to condense a whole book saga in one movie, which I think was a giant mistake. We're looking at a TV series, so that concern is pretty much moot.

IThinkTheClockIsSlow,You missed the Dune part too.  The number of successful adaptions of BELOVED books is not good.  Yes there are exceptions, but, my fears are based on past experience.  As I stated I would love to see something close.  Have learned to not get my hopes up.

NoMouseville,Brian Herbert is the exact opposite of Christopher Tolkien. He has basically cashed in his father's vision with the help of a mediocre writer (Kevin J Anderson) and turned it into a stream of airport bookstore sci-fi crap.

shavarg0,goddam you all are some negative people. im excited. if it sucks it sucks, if its great itll be the best thing in the long while.

IPAddict,I'm glad there are some of us who aren't so pessimistic about it. I'm very excited as well, and there's literally nothing for us to lose as fans if it somehow misses the mark or just plain fails miserably. Just give it a chance. If the Tolkien Estate is allowing this, that has to be a good sign. This may be a bit different in some regards, but if A Song of Ice and Fire can be adapted so well to a TV series, I believe it can be done for Tolkien's universe as well. I'd expect Christopher Tolkien and the Estate will have a heavy influence on the writing of the series.

How could you not be excited for this?

shnock12,Exactly. If it sucks, it changes absolutely nothing about the Tolkien universe, and can just be ignored 

theblueredpanda,Right? Can't understand why so many fans are bummed out about this. It's a win-win - roll the dice with good odds ($250m) and if it works then it's another great addition to the Tolkien-verse; if it's bad, we just give it the ol' Hobbit trilogy cold shoulder

Indosay,I'm pumped.  I remember when the movies came out and everyone was saying the same shit.  "They'll never be able to do it, it'll never work, these movies are going to be awful, yadda yadda."  And now they're considered some of the greatest movies ever made.  Heck, even when they were first coming out I remember people having issues with them and not looking on them as fondly as people do now.  They got quite a bit of shit from LotR book fans back in the day.  

People always gotta be grumpy about something.  Is this show going to retroactively ruin the books for anyone?  Of course not.  Worst case scenario, the show sucks and you don't watch it and it doesn't matter.  Best case scenario, it's amazing and we all enjoy it and it introduces a new generation to Middle earth and we all love it.  

sakor88,> They'll never be able to do it, it'll never work, these movies are going to be awful

Umm... and they were not exactly wrong either.

aclaec42,Absolutely, I hate them. FOTR was decent, the other two were butchery.

NoMouseville,Yeah. They were pretty. Using New Zealand was an inspired way to capture the fantasy landscape, the costume design was interesting and the casting was decent. Not to mention bringing the fantasy genre back into the mainstream, which was and is an achievement still relevant in television and film to this day.

... but I hate them. I can't watch them from start to finish without getting irrationally angry.

sakor88,> I can't watch them from start to finish without getting irrationally angry.

Oh, I can. Odd if you have that experience.

NoMouseville,Hyperbole; I just don't watch them because I find them unenjoyable and irritating.

sakor88,There indeed are scenes that are unenjoyable and irritating.

Indosay,Most people would disagree with you and say the movies were great.  To me, they don't feel like LotR exactly, but they were fun, good movies that I've always enjoyed.  

sakor88,> Most people would disagree with you and say the movies were great.

Most people are... well...

Indosay,My comment is in respect to the many people on reddit who I've seen say things like "the movies were incredible and nothing will ever be as good as those movies so they shouldn't try anymore and the show will be awful because it'll never be as good as the movies."  I was just saying people said the same thing about the movies before they came out.  It's just funny to see the same type of comments 15 years later or whatever.  I loved the movies and I'm sure I'll enjoy the show.  Again, nothing has really felt like Middle earth to me the way the books do, but that's just how these things always are.  I'm excited to see what a new team of people come up with.  

sakor88,I do not think that the books ought not to be adapted because "they are incredible and nothing will ever be as good as the books etc". I think Lord of the Rings SHOULD be adapted again, if for no other reason then to break the hegemony of Jacksonverse interpretation.

gytherin,"I think Lord of the Rings SHOULD be adapted again, if for no other reason then to break the hegemony of Jacksonverse interpretation."

Excellent point.  I agree, but am still nervous.

sakor88,So am I. We do not yet even know what they are planning to adapt. I suppose it is going to be some romance between a balrog and an elf.

naner00,hahahaha...LOL !!

can it get worse ? I don't think so.

Sinhika,I think every fandom has its [RUINED FOREVER!](http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ruined_FOREVER) contingent. Shockingly, it rarely, if ever, happens.

Amedais,Agreed. I get that people are sceptical, but with $250 million of money going into the rights alone, I'm pretty damn excited about the kind of budget that we are going to see here. 

Kookanoodles,The Hobbit was so bad *because* it had too much money thrown at it. A big budget is no guarantee of quality.

kapparoth,Exactly. The bigger the budget, the more invasive the executive meddling. And you can't really blame them either - the more there is at stake, the safer they want to play. Unfortunately, in that particular case, safe play means bending the original to make it follow the formula that sells.

None,[deleted]

Kookanoodles,Yeah the poor guy was just thrust into the whole mess. They don't even attempt to hide it in the DVD extras for Battle of the Five Armies, they very candidly show how he had no idea where it was going and had to pause production.

sakor88,Well... I hope that Tolkien Estate will use the money to good things like it has thus far (as far as I am aware).

arvy_p,Yeah, if it turns out poorly, we can just not watch it, and still enjoy the books we have.  If it turns out well, then awesome.

None,You ever notice how Tolkien fans are some of the few fans that dread expansion of their Tolkien universe? There's a reason for this.. because it's just about as damn near perfect as it can get. Adding, exploring, explaining, or changing anything more than is already established is only going to saturate the lore and sacrifice quality for quantity. Why can't they just fucking leave it alone? If the Tolkien fans themselves are weary of this then who the hell do they think is gonna watch it or buy in to this??

Kookanoodles,Yeah literally everybody is going to watch this. Tolkien fans were wary of the movies too and they're only the most successful trilogy of all time.

kapparoth,Tolkien and *The Lord of the Rings* have become household names far outside the fandom as we knew it. We should be aware that at least some of our objections to the upcoming series will be seen as an unnecessary nitpicking at best and gatekeeping at worst.

sakor88,> If the Tolkien fans themselves are weary of this then who the hell do they think is gonna watch it or buy in to this??

DKLond,Personally, I would prefer a purist Hobbit+LotR take - going all in on detail and world building.

I loved FotR - the movie - even if it had many flaws. TTT and RotK have steadily fallen from grace in my view as the years have gone by and I've been more objective when viewing them. Also, it didn't exactly help that they all but ruined Faramir, being my favorite LotR character.

So, I think there's PLENTY of room for doing it right - and adding all the details that the movies missed, without inventing shit for "drama" purposes.

However, the price of the license means there's no way they're taking a big risk here - so I'm sure it will be a pretty safe GoT clone with "inspiration" from Tolkien.

e122,I'm excited to see another adaptation if only because the Jackson films shafted a lot of my favorite characters, and I'm hoping that if they show up in the Amazon show they'll be characterized a bit better. Honestly I'm a bit tired of the films being considered THE adaptation anyway, so more and different interpretations are welcome in my book. Sherlock Holmes has been adapted probably hundreds of times at this point and it hasn't diminished the original stories.

undergarden,In case any of you are concerned (or hoping) for a salacious GoT-style treatment of LOTR, one was already written by John Boorman when he hoped to make it. 

Frodo and Galadriel have sex in it.

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/John_Boorman%27s_The_Lord_of_the_Rings

kapparoth,To be honest, I like their version of the duel between Gandalf and Saruman more than what we've got in the movie.

Evan_Th,There are a lot of versions of that duel I'd like more than what we got in Jackson's movie.

kapparoth,But this particular one sounds almost as if they knew of the duel between Sauron and Finrod.

Evan_Th,That's the perfect model.  I love that idea, and I wish someone would follow it.

Unfortunately, the four lines I've seen quoted - even though they're still better than Jackson - don't really convey that to me.  They're an outline you could use to write songs like Finrod sung, but they're not a Tolkenesque duel of poetry:

>GANDALF: Saruman, I am the snake about to strike!  
  SARUMAN: I am the staff that crushes the snake!  
  GANDALF: I am the fire that burns the staff to ashes!  
  SARUMAN: I am the cloudburst that quenches the fire!

I don't understand the need for this to be set in between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

I know that The Silmarillion would be hard to adapt for a television series, since its more like the Bible then a traditional novel. 

They could take a part out of the Silmarillion and adapt it. Or even better, do Children of Hurin. It could work, and it is more dark then other Tolkiens work. I bet they will have Game of Thrones in mind when creating this, since it's so popular. So why not adapt The Children if Hurin?

I can't believe people bought this bullshit

helpmeredditimbored,I'm sorry, but you're a fucking idiot and have no sympathy from me. 

justanothertransgril,Welp, guess I'm going to go back to the other side.  Maybe I'll find someone who accepts me eventually.

sparkynuts,You're not an idiot.  You're brave because you admitted to making a mistake.  Like many people, you were duped.  You've learned a lesson.  

One the biggest things that you can do to help prevent being duped in the future is to learn about logical fallacies:

http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy

Just learning the meaning of them is helpful.  From there, you can find starter courses or something like a written article or summary.  You don't have to memorize the entire large list of them.  The most encountered dozen or so account for the vast majority that you'll encounter.

Chin up mate :)

Comrade_Belinski,Anyone that believed this is a easily deceived fool. It's trump, he is known for lying, misogyny and racism. 

Pyryara,I remember asking some Trump supporters whether they really honestly believed Trump was pro-LGBT. They are such dishonest dimwits.

hoping4rein,>I can't believe people bought this bullshit 
  
Have you *seen* Trump supporters? It makes every bit of sense that they would buy into bullshit of all varieties of shape, size and pungentness. These people are barley hovering over the floor of human intelligence. 

WinterAyars,Yep, Trump scumsuckers were saying he was the *real* pro-LGBT candidate. Do not believe his lies.

AirRaidJade,What's even more incredible is that practically every LGBT person I know voted for Trump. Mostly because of this. *Even AFTER* he chose Pence as his VP - that alone should have showed them the truth, but they were too stupid to see it because "Crooked Hillary corrupt, emails Benghazi emails pizza!"

ITworksGuys,They are no longer going to provide hormone treatments, therapy, or surgeries.  

If you successfully mask it and serve your tour then more power to you.

I still think they shouldn't.  The military can be an extremely stressful job.


Amelia_Frye,*Everyone* is affected poorly by stress. Not just trans people.

FreakinGeese,>Banning transgender people in the military is impossible.

NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE

isodeslk,> Banning transgender people in the military is impossible.

Oh its far from impossible. There are many things you could say about this--- that it's dumb, pointless, counter productive, malicious. But *impossible*?

If they treat it as one of the disqualifying medical conditions that prevents people from being taken in and-or kicks out those already in the service, it would be inconsequential to reject people as their trans-status is discovered.

They look into service peoples' backgrounds anyway if-when they go for clearance, and the military has its own healthcare system whose documents they have access to through computer searches. This really would *not* be difficult to do.

A ex of mine made it into the marines w/out disclosing a congenital birth defect (he did know about it beforehand). *Eventually* they did find out about it, and when they did they simply kicked him out. No pension or anything- because he had intentionally not told them about it when required to do so.


ruler_gurl,Yup, it's probably easier than it's ever been because the glimmer of hope people had, has I'm sure led a lot of people to open up about it which leaves them wide open to being discharged now.

Both really irritate me, and I think transgenders were a lot better off before they became a political issue. 


If it ever becomes convenient for democrats to hate trans people they will do it(Look at the number of democrat politicians who said they were against gay marriage back when it was fashionable to do so).

StellarValkyrie,Whelp, there goes my plans... 

Theoderic77,Sorry :( There's always the Peace Corps, which is often for two years. Often times you'll need a bachelor's to it though. In 3 years though you should still be good to join the military, hopefully.

Fim0458,Arent they technically still part of the US military? 

Theoderic77,Nope! It's a volunteer program ran and funded by the government. It is not an enlistment into the military. The two function very differently. It doesn't pay nearly as well, but it is generally only for two years, there are no uniforms, no fitness tests, no combat readiness training, and you do the service to make a difference rather than to earn a pay check. Old couples will occasionally do it with each other. Of course, some of the countries the Peace Corps does work in are not places where trans or gay people would want to be for safety reasons, but there are no gender or sexual barriers to be in the Peace Corps.

Cyanotical,iirc peace corp service automatically disqualifies you from having a clearance. there's a ton of military related private industry jobs that require a clearance. imo i'd find another route, military jobs don't last forever.

truetrans, No, I got a secret security clearance with the US Air Force after my peace corps service.

BrockenSpecter,I find it impossible to imagine conservatives are capable of holding social experiments. I think its more like Conservatives don't understand what a social experiment is and just throw the term around to justify and dismiss the ban.

IronMyr,Are you suggesting that the conservative party is against freedom and actively pursues a more powerful government?

painalfulfun,I don't think the conservatives are the ones giving out welfare to people who refuse to work and still have 20 kids.

NagyYT,How does us spending lots of money on medical procedures affect the military's money? 

Enleat,Not much. The 'offical' budget of the military is 60 billion, but along with the 'black budget' it's around 600-800 billion apparently.

ruler_gurl,Not sure where you heard that number was "official".  The official number is [$634B](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/analysis/2015/presidents-2016-budget-in-pictures/).  It has for my entire lifetime been the single largest element of the discretionary budget and Trump wants to increase it to one trillion.

RadRandy,When did he say he wants to increase it to one trillion?

ruler_gurl,It stuck in head head back in fall.  [Here's one article](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestiefer/2016/11/09/president-trump-is-likely-to-boost-u-s-military-spending-by-500-billion-to-1-trillion/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/).  But of course he's like a schizophrenic and changes his tune on things between every press conference.  His formal request for the next fiscal year was apparently 54B and even that isn't going to happen.

RadRandy,That article was completely speculative. Nowhere did Trump say he was going to increase it to 1 trillion. That's what the author of the article thinks he's going to do.

ruler_gurl,But it was based on his  "wish list" which he does keep blurting out.  At some part people start making logical assumptions.

RadRandy,His "wish list" didn't include a one trillion dollar defense budget. All those ships, planes, tanks etc are to be built over years and years to come. That's why he he wanted to raise it $54 billion to pay for all of it. The current DoD budget is 574 billion. If that increased to one trillion, you'd be able to pay for a helluva lot more than what was on his wish list. So how is it logical to think that the extra planes and ships are going to add up to an extra 400 billion?

ranma1_5,Gotta pay for the yearly shipment of new office chairs somehow

Enleat,My mistake then.

CaptainRyn,Assumption by a bunch of old white men that SRS costs like a million bucks.

Its ignorance, but in 2016 ignorance won.

cuttincows,I always find it humorous how an appendectomy is more dangerous, more expensive, _and_ more complicated than SRS, yet providing care for soldiers with appendicitis isn't something that "a bunch of old white men" would blink an eye at.

CaptainRyn,Probably because they think the surgery we need is a lobotomy, not SRS.

cuttincows,Tbh that whole setup from Sense8 was literally my worst fear and reminded me exactly why I moved away from my parents. It rang a little too close to home ;_;

thisisntnamman,It's not a lot of procedures and it's not a lot of money. I bet we spend more of our tax $ on Trump's golf
bill then on transgender surgery in the military. 

cuttincows,We've spent a _magnitude_ more on Trump's golfing than _medically necessary care_ on fit soldiers.

skin87,It's a rounding error. The DoD spends $47.8 billion on medical expenses every year and transition care was expected to raise that by $5.7 million, or 0.01%.

CaptainSchmid,I know it seems like (and the courts will probably find it to be) discrimination, but I think the concern is that transgender people won't be able to get hormone injections in the field much like diabetics can't join because it's very hard to get insulin out to the field. Also the article most likely doesn't tell the whole story because this is still a plan rather than fact. I did read on the r/news version's thread that a soldier was debriefed and told that it was only during the transitional phase of gender reassignment surgery. Although I am not an expert on either gender reassignment or military strategy and logistics, I hope I could help show another side to the debate.

Emilythequestioning,Actually, they permit other chronic health conditions like hypothyroidism if it is controlled. 

This means that there is precident for suppling required chronic medication for ENTRY in to military service.  HRT is no different in terms of being chronic but not needing an active supply line.  

Diabetus isn't a good example because it can easily slide in to acute problems without insulin or other blood sugar controlling medicine.  

None,[deleted]

sexymcluvin,I serve. There has been no mention or any briefings from the top yet in my experience. Plus, there have already been things in the works, like the Army as a branch allowing individuals to serve, based on commander's recommendations, before the ban was lifted. There was a study done for month weighing the costs and benefits, which included input from other countries' militaries that have had inclusive policies for years.

Chatmauve,If I have my testicles removed it's not like they will grow back in the field...! 🤣

cantdressherself,Injected Hormones are not required for transition.  Trans women can take oral medication, trans men can use topicaly applied gels.  Even if injections were the only appropriate method of delivery, they dont need to be refridgerated like insulin.  The two are not the same.  

None,[deleted]

cantdressherself,I don't think it's different.  I would be ok if there were consistancy, like if there had never been a question of trans people in the military.  I'm not fine with us being the targets of a political witch hunt.  One president asks the generals " can we get by with trans servicepeople?"  And the generals say "yes, we can make it work."  Then the next says "we dont want you in our military" basically.  

Lux-xxv,They even make hormone patches. 

CaptainSchmid,Thank you for telling me, I like to hear both sides of a story before making an opinion, I actually came to this subreddit trying to find out about that but I saw this post and didn't see any other sides for the argument so I figured I would get responses faster by stating the other side.

cantdressherself,Honestly, GRSv is a big commitment for a trans woman.  Besides 3 weeks total rest for recovery, part of their after care is they have to dilate 5x/day for 30-40 minutes each for the first 3 months.  After that you don't have to be so intensive, but it's a big commitment and difficult to work around a job.  

I don't know what the after care is like for trans men, though I imagine it's not as intensive.  

livingonsweetnuthing,Also just to add in, that missing a dosage of testosterone for long term users doesn't inherently mean a significant change for the individual. 

I know plenty of long term users of t who have missed their dosages, and the main complaint is a shift in mood. But none of them said that it was /that/ significant, it was more like "yeah I guess I was more irritable". No anger issues mentioned, it was akin to being slightly more cranky. 

I say this cause my experience going off t for two months suddenly was really different. I had no side effects. I was in a really low dosage and I was already happy with the permanent affects of t. I am currently off of it completely just cause I already got the masculization that I wanted and don't need t anymore. 

Don't doubt that others may have different experiences about missing a dose, but that'll go for any medication whatsoever. 

Lovtel,Every post I've seen about this on other subreddits has commenters raving about how this makes sense because no one who "needs medication to LIVE" should be allowed in combat. 

I'm not on hormones, but I'm preeeeettttyyy sure skipping them doesn't kill you. 

truetrans,Yeah. For the vast majority of trans people, it amounts to just a few pills and a couple doctor's visits a year. It really isn't as extreme wacky and wild as conservatives like to think.

softpeachie,Not only that, but it's not like they can't just place trans people in non combat situations. i have severe depression and recruiters have been trying to recruit me into the band for their branch since my freshman year. I explained one time I have depression, and the guy said that that's fine since military band is non combative.

starlight_chaser,Yeah but there's not much guarantee that if you sign up for the military that they won't put you in combat. If you're in, you're gonna serve as needed. They'll tell you all kinds of shit to get you to join, that's why they start recruiting even while kids are in high school, to manipulate their perception of the job. It's not a cushy job where you can do whatever you want or get special treatment. It's called a service for a reason.

crymearicki,I'd just like to see an answer on what a conservative actually is, if it isn't a Republican. Every time I ask this question I get confused and contradictory answers. Can you please clarify this for me?

paolellagram,So generally a conservative is someone who is quite cautious with change. They usually try to uphold tradition and if new regulations are to be impacted they won't interfere with the status quo. It just so happens at this moment conservatives are generally republicans, while democrats are generally liberal. This is how we saw a switch in political party support in the elections from 1960-1968. And finally conservatism became a republican staple with Reagan in 1980. 

crymearicki,So like the Amish then? 

The same Amish that welcome women's rights or..... what's that term I was thinking of... oh! i remember, LGBT rights.

paolellagram,Well yeah the Amish are generally considered very conservative, and I'm not sure where you got your info on Amish views but they don't really welcome LGBT rights. They're pretty against LGBT actually and think most of the beliefs in the community are sinful. 

crymearicki,> They're pretty against LGBT actually

Poster3433,how is this even legal??? isn't it pure blatant discrimination? I mean denying medical is one thing, but an out and out ban is fucking fascist. No other western nation is like this, to my knowledge.

aham1994,Its legal because discrimination based on gender identity isn't illegal. You can still be fired or denied jobs for being trans. The civil rights act will not be ammended for a very long time.

IronMyr,I can't think of any temporal law that has been violated, technically.

Moral law, Divine law, definitely, but nothing in our law codes.

CraftyMuthafucka,I hate Trump as much as anyone, but how is this "fascist"?   The left is turning into the boy who cried wolf. We overuse every word until it no longer even means anything.

This ban is many terrible things, but it's not fascist.

FallsZero,Preach, Def using fascism label too much 

cuttincows,It's an abuse of power based on personal beliefs - even if it's not directly fascist, the word pulls up imagery that is relevant in this specific situation, regardless of whether or not it's accurate.

CraftyMuthafucka,It's literally none of those things. It's a disagreement on policy.

cuttincows,But the policy itself is discriminatory - policies fueled by fear similar to this during the 1930s to 1940s are what caused ethnic minorities to be ostracized. I'm not calling him any of this, but I can absolutely see the parallels through history, even if it's on a very different scale.

JeremyHall,Yeah, all those separate water coolers for trannies.

cuttincows,Separate bathrooms aren't that far off, honestly.  
  
Also, you should probably refrain from using slurs like that, especially on inclusive subs, of all places.

JeremyHall,Oh I get it. You get to decide what I can and can't say. No wonder the high commands don't want to deal with y'all. 

cuttincows,I'm not saying you _can't_ say that, I'm saying that _I personally_ am hurt by that phrase, and it adds nothing to a discussion but anger and spite. All we ask for is being treated as human beings, with respect and dignity, and I can say for certain you wouldn't appreciate if I started hurling slurs your way. Additionally, the first amendment (which is usually used in this kind of situation) only prevents prosecution by the government based on speech, and doesn't protect you or anyone else from social ramifications or repercussions from society, and [hate speech](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/06/19/supreme-court-unanimously-reaffirms-there-is-no-hate-speech-exception-to-the-first-amendment/) (which slurs such as the N word, T word, et cetera) is absolutely _not_ protected speech; even the [military](https://www.reddit.com/r/newtothenavy/comments/4uuvea/insults_in_bootcampnavy/) doesn't put up with it.  
  
If you'd like to calmly discuss any issues you see with transgender soldiers or you'd like to pose some of your preconceptions about what being transgender means, I absolutely have time to discuss the topic with you. my only request is that you leave hatred at the door.

starlight_chaser,There is no such thing as hate speech. Speech that calls people to act on violence isn't allowed, the incitement of violence isn't protected, screaming fire in a theatre isn't protected, but speech that simply makes someone, as an individual, uncomfortable, is definitely protected.    
   
Or else it would entail double standards, right? Otherwise, wouldn't all the people screaming "Fascist!" at anyone that disagrees with them be using hate-speech as well? It's not a very considerate response, nor does it really clarify someone's position. I wish people could have civilized conversation with others even if they disagree. No name-calling, just an explanation of each side.

cuttincows,But I'm not name calling??? I didn't call you cis (regardless of if it's considered hate speech or not), and I didn't scream "fascist". I'm _currently_ attempting to have a civilized debate with you as to why you feel transgender individuals shouldn't be allowed in the military.  
  
To start off, here's my current stance on the relevant issue in question:  
I personally believe that transgender individuals should be allowed in the military because, assuming they're not getting affirmative surgeries on the front line or in times of combat, they will be as effective as their non-trans (since you seen to dislike the work "cis") counterparts.  In the [DSM-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5), transgenderism is no longer classified as a mental illness - instead, Gender Dysphoria, which is the illness associated with untreated transgenderism, is the diagnosis, and it is both treatable and curable. The cure is gender affirmative surgery (which I'll leave out for the sake of this argument), and HRT. HRT is one of the simplest medical treatments possible, requiring (in my case) a single pill that's taken once a day, and a patch that's swapped out twice a week. I have few to no adverse effects if I miss a dose or two, and can be combat effective without treatment. This treatment is also used for non transgender soldiers, too - Estradiol patches are used to suppress menopause symptoms in non-trans women, spironolactone is used to treat high blood pressure, and testosterone injections are useful for men unable to produce enough of the drug themselves (hypogonadism). None of these, if controlled with reasonable medication, or the don't impede in the soldier's ability to concentrate / do their job, directly make the soldier disqualified from the military (some are case by case).  
If this is true, then the only other difference from a non-trans soldier would be suicide rate (which [decreases significantly after treatment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/2yltjj/does_transitioning_reduce_the_risk_of_suicide_in/)), and personality, which there are no direct restrictions on in the military (each case is persion-to-person)  
  
Feel free to attempt refute any of my points, or pose new ones for _me_ to attempt to refute.

starlight_chaser,First of all, I didn't say you were the one screaming "fascist". Second, I guess it's fine for you to call me whatever you want. "Cis" won't stop me from sleeping at night, even if you have no idea of how *I* identify with gender. Second, missing one or two daily doses doesn't affect you? What about a bit longer? Is it really the responsibility of the military to accommodate someone for the surgery and medicine for the long-term? Because it's quite possible that you could be deployed and not have access to the pills or gels for longer than two days. I also don't think that the military should fund viagra for non-life-threatening reasons, maybe for blood pressure or whatever, if there *is* any good reason for it.    
   
Do you think that something like long-term break from the hormones could cause an adverse affect? Many people argue that the acceptance of another person's gender and the expression of that gender (such as with hormones) is so important to mental health, and that lack of expression is what raises the suicide rates. If a history of depression or bipolar disorder can be used to discriminate against someone applying for service, why not a condition (body dysphoria) that is shown to cause or be co-morbid with depression and anxiety, and cause a person to feel suicidal? A person with bipolar disorder can be extremely capable, and can be as effective as their peers. But they can even be barred from getting security clearance if they wanted to stay in, let's say, an engineering defense job, for example. They're not allowed, because there are risks, or at least the military perceives risks, and the military has the right to discriminate based on physical and mental reasons. If the transition and drug is what helps the suicide rate, then it seems like under the stressful situation that every member of the military needs to be prepared for, it would be excessive to expect that they could reasonably survive without it when it isn't available, right? Their mental state would have to be expected to stay stable even in absence of the drugs for long-term, it's a demanding job.    
   
I'm a bit confused, especially considering the duress that soldiers go through on the battlefield, that if they have difficulty remaining strong while being misgendered, which I know causes a lot of mental distress and even suicidal ideation, and since vocal support is so important to their recovery, then wouldn't the harsh and likely verbally abusive training be too much? With a mean drill sargent insulting you? Or someone calling you the wrong gender as they try to focus on more pressing issues? If a person can't remain mentally stable while being exposed to rough words, how well can they hold up to physical, emotional and mental difficulty and the horrors of war? 
edit: wrong contraction

cuttincows,I assumed you were cisgender because I assumed I had been responding to a single user (/u/JeremyHall) who volunteered "Do you think I like being referred to as 'cis'?", I generally try not to make unbased assumptions as a rule, and apologize for any that were unfounded.  
  
According to the current military guidelines, somebody who's prescribed a medication for, say, high blood pressure, and without it, their life would directly be in jeopardy, would be disqualified from service. That's actually a really good basis for an argument, and we can work from there. Then the question becomes more nuanced:

>"should someone whose life isn't directly threatened by discontinuing a necessary medication (regardless of if the military itself pays for it, that's a debate for a different time) for a short period of time be allowed to serve? For how long before it becomes a problem? And do transgender people count under this label?"

The answer to this question, and where different transgender individuals fall into this, honestly differs person to person. I know I, myself, can go for maybe a handful of weeks without hormones before suffering mental health effects, and even before hormones (which is the state I lived in fine for 21 years of my life), I'd be absolutely fit, physically and mentally for service - I just feel healthier and more myself on hormones. Some people are more, some are less, some transgender people _don't take hormones at all_. Nonbinary individuals are, by definition, transgender, and many don't take hormones, and many binary trans individuals. This makes the argument even more nuanced, because trans individuals who suffer little harmful dysphoria (around 60%, according to figures being thrown around, assuming _all_ of the suicidal ideation is from needing HRT) wouldn't _need_ the medication on the battlefield, but may simply feel more comfortable with it (like how you might feel more comfortable near a fire on a chilly day, but can work out in the cold as long as needed).  
  
The second major point of your arguments has some minor rhetoric pieces that could be pulled apart from a different angle, so I'm going to analyze through a few different lenses. If a black man can't even be called a slur on the streets without distress, should he be able to serve? Undoubtedly so, I'm sure most Americans would agree. Most halfway decent soldiers wouldn't even _consider_ hurling insults at them, and those around them would quickly correct them. But what if this happens in a combat scenario? Well, they'd likely mention it as applicable later. This is going a bit into the fields of political correctness and personal kindness, which are a bit out of scope for the discussion, but they're food for thought.  I, and all trans people I know personally, are _consistantly_ misgendered on a day to day basis, have been for our entire lives, and likely will be until ~1 year into our transitions. After this, we'd be just about indistinguishable from a cis individual of the same gender, so someone misgendering us on the fly is unlikely, and beforehand it's expected. Honestly, the only people I've seen fly off the handle / be unstable because of misgendering are the strawmen of SJWs on the internet, of whom are not only few and far between in real life.  
  
Breaking down what I've pulled and somewhat agreed with in your argument, I agree that people who need medication for physical and / or mental stability for their position in the military over a set period of time (likely different per role, and the majority of the military isn't on the front line away from care, but that's a different point) shouldn't be allowed in the military (or at least that role). According to the current [Navy Guidelines on prescription](http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/health-promotion-wellness/preventing-drug-alcohol-abuse/Prescription-Drug-Misuse-article.pdf), the only restrictions on active prescriptions is that of their use _outside_ of their prescribed use. However, I found several sources listing not to bring prescription drugs to boot camp, as they'd be taken away. Upon further investigation, I found [several](https://www.quora.com/When-I-enlist-in-the-U-S-Marines-throughout-boot-camp-and-overseas-can-I-take-medicine-like-Benadryl-because-I-have-a-pretty-bad-allergy-to-pollen) [sources](http://www.leatherneck.com/forums/showthread.php?98830-Prescription-Medication-and-Boot-Camp) that state "you can't bring your own medication, but can be re-prescribed it", which sounds fair to me. Should someone who could succumb to a debilitating 20 second sneezing attack in a combat situation be disallowed from service? According to current military procedures, no, and if _every_ medical condition requiring simple medication made you exempt from service, I'd wager a non negligible number of soldiers would be out of work (or uncomfortable, in many cases more so in any moment than a trans soldier).  
  
So, if someone can't survive without medication, should they be allowed in the military? According to current guidelines, it depends, but as dysphoria care is preventative (such as hay fever medication, which is common) as opposed to reactionary (such as an asthma inhaler) and treats the source, not a symptom (such as ADHD medication, which has significantly more side effects than the testosterone or estrogen that's in your body naturally), I'd argue that it's within acceptable guidelines. The question of if we'd remain stable under duress / the sting of rough words is a different point, but, honestly, if we're going to have slurs slung at us on the street and be misgendered regularly and stay strong either way, why does it matter if it happens to us on the battlefield?

None,[removed]

cuttincows,I'm going to repeat - is there anything you're interested in learning here? If not, you're in the wrong place.

Mecaterpillar,I'm pretty sure the military is allowed to discriminate on the basis of medical conditions (in particular they disqualify people from joining if they have certain medical conditions).  As for whether they are allowed to discriminate simply on the basis of being transgender (as opposed to having gender dysphoria), I don't know.  However, given that the military had special rules about gay and lesbian people being able to join or being separated if found out (that whole DADT policy still strikes me as ridiculous) and did previously ban transgender people, I'm guessing it's probably legal.  It's probably one of those things that is legal until Congress says otherwise, like DADT was.

Jyiiga,This is not surprising at all considering how stringent the military is in it's medical standards.

Oh you took some depression meds while in middle school? Disqualified.

Bout of asthma when you were 14? Disqualified.

Tore your ACL once five years ago and made a full recovery? Disqualified.

I don't think people realize there are so many little things that can disqualify you from service. There's even a saying that goes like this: "If everybody was truthful about their medical history; nobody would get in".

However, I consider all of this to be a symptom of our broken healthcare system. Most expensive in the world. While offering the worst care when compared to other modern nations.

If I had my way our armed forces would start shrinking today. Until it was cut in half within a decade. Wasted resources.


Dracomarine,I agreed with you up until the end, you don't want a power vacuum of the US stepping down. It would end in china or russia stepping up. And that is not a good thing for us.

Jyiiga,I would agree if there was a close second. There isn't. 

We have more foreign bases than any people, nation or empire in history.

We have over 800 bases in the US, 170 in Germany, 110 in Japan, 83 in South Korea and hundreds more in 80 other nations. We have more naval might than the rest of the globe combined. Yet we can't provide quality healthcare to our own people. We spend entirely to much money on defense. 

Dracomarine,You are looking at this all wrong. We CA. Provide healthcare, education, green energy, and a strong military. But we choose not to as a nation. Our country wants to do all of these things but isn't willing to give what it takes. Now, the lower and middle class already sacrifice alot. The blame doesn't really lie with them. But they do benefit from having a large a strong military.

weedtese,Question. When someone transitioned years ago legally and medically, how do they tell? 

MrJockStrap,They look at you naked...

amadeoamante,Can't always tell from that.  Even doctors.

None,[deleted]

amadeoamante,A red flag for what lol?  And I guess there must be an awful lot of incompetent doctors out there.

MrJockStrap,Trust me, when they inspect your genitals, they will know whether or not it's fake. They inspect literally hundreds every day.

weedtese,> fake

fuck you

MrJockStrap,Fake - not genuine



weedtese,My genitals are genuine, thank you very much. 

MrJockStrap,That's good, I'm talking about trans people.

amadeoamante,I'm assuming you mean "genitals".  Have you ever even seen a completed phalloplasty or vaginoplasty?  There are trans porn stars out there that you can look up who've had it done if you're curious.  And yes, plenty of trans people have amusing stories about doctors who had no clue after examining them.

MrJockStrap,Im assuming you are trting to correct me on something that didnt need correcting? Either way, best of luck to them if they try, but its very unlikely that they wont be flagged.

amadeoamante,For someone post op, it's more likely to come up in a background check than on physical examination.  And that will depend on when the person transitioned and what paperwork was required, which depends on the state they were born in and the state and county they did their paperwork in.

jahs_126,hormone therapy is glaringly obvious

medical records and/or physical evaluations

my father(or whatever you want to call her) was still on hormones 20 years after the surgery.. also a bronze star vietnam vet.. my brother sort of appreciates the fact she didnt live to see trumps administration

weedtese,Not only trans people need hormone replacement 

cantdressherself,Hormone treatment is for life, even post surgery.  I don't know if hipaa privacy laws apply tonservice members, but it would be a difficult thing to hide, even for passing folks.  

TransparentLove,Probably be outed by a background check and blood work. 

ranma1_5,Background check maybe, but blood work wouldn't show anything

TransparentLove,A simple DNA test will show XX or XY chromosome. They DNA does not even need to sequenced to figure out the chromosomal sex marker. 

And yes, part of the process of joining the US Armed Forces is having your DNA kept on file with the DOD. 

Can you tell my why you claim that blood work won't show anything?  

ranma1_5,Because standard lab work doesn't include that, they'd just see your hormone levels.

I had honestly forgotten about the DNA sample they took at MEPS. I'm not even sure what they did with that. Either way, discriminating based on chromosomes wouldn't work because there are cis men with XX and cis women with XY. Although I guess an administration like this one would consider those acceptable losses...

TransparentLove,Well if they (POTUS, gov, and DOD) are implementing a new policy to ban trans folk, why would not implement a new policy for screening potential enlistees and candidates?  A blood test would be fairly quick and easy to weed out fully transitioned trans people. And if they get conflicting results from the blood test, an extensive background check or polygraph test would likely out the trans person. 

Also if they lied on their forms and signed a line such as "I solemnly swear I have never to my knowledge undergone gender treatment, hormone therapy or reassignment surgery of any sort."
Then it would be considered a federal offense and fraud and they would be heavily prosecuted if the truth ever came out. 



meliaesc,I mean, the same principle applied with Don't Ask, Don't Tell... Sure, you can choose to not disclose it, but it doesn't change the intent or your treatment.

helpmeredditimbored,this is about politics, pure and simple 

>Just spoke to a Trump administration official about the transgender military decision. Here's what they said...
>>This forces Democrats in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin to take complete ownership on this issue. How will blue collar voters in these states respond when Senators up for re-election in 2018 like Debbie Stabenow are forced to make their opposition to this a key plank of their campaigns?" 

https://twitter.com/jonathanvswan/status/890202683721863168

TheAnswerIsAQuestion,This is even worse if it's the real reason. Screwing with the lives of thousands of people for potential political gain (which is relying on bigotry and hatred in the targeted voters). 

EmeraldPen,I don't buy that.  People don't have to make it central to their campaigns unless he starts seriously rolling back and pushing forward blatantly unconstitutional limits on the rights of trans people.  Think a bathroom bill EO, or flying restrictions or something.

And even then you have to keep in mind that a Republican controlled legislature JUST soundly shot down legislation which would have had the same effect.  Trump is actually more conservative on this issue now than the legislative branch.

This isn't 264D interdimensional chess.  This is a transparent attempt to distract from healthcare and Russia by pillorying a minority group that people are learning to care about.

chrkchrkchrk,Bleh. This is giving Trump too much credit. That might be a good way for that official to spin this crazy shit and may very well be an effect of his actions, but no one in their right mind should believe these sorts of "3D chess" narratives about Trump at this point. Any political use the party gets out of his harebrained actions is simply due to lucky coincidence or concerted efforts to squeeze utility out of them.

edit to clarify: The only person who purposely benefits from this is Trump, who knows this shit is red meat for his (dwindling and depressed) base.

Less than 1% of Males in the US identify as transgender.

Total US population is about 324 million.

Let's assume 50% are males, so ~162 million males in US.

~ 0.004% of US population are Active military Personnel 

Less than ~1,620,000 transgender males in US

Assuming Transgender males are equally likely to join military as non-transgender males: (obviously an extremely rough estimate) ~6,500 potential Active military Personnel who are transgender males.

**~0.00004%** of US males will be affected by this. Don't quote me on any of the numbers, this is just to get a very rough idea of how many males alone would be affected.

weedtese,Please elaborate 

Poster3433,you have first hand experience serving alongside trans people? Do you even know any? My whole family served and i bet most of them would eat punks like you for breakfast lol. And not one of them agrees with this, 4 generations. 

Also, if you served, and weren't a deadshit they had clean latrines, you would know 2/3 of roles are non combat.

TransparentLove,Hahaha I like you :D

Also from my experience in the Marines, I'd say it's closer to 4/5 of the military are non-combat jobs that provide support roles for combat elements.  And even that 1/5 that are in combat units- many still never see active combat. 

Poster3433,thanks you too!

isodeslk,> I know first hand that having transgender people in the ranks of Marines would be too disruptive. In combat, it could be a matter of life and death.

Okay, story time- let's hear your experience where this happened.



Mecaterpillar,I actually was looking forward to hearing this (looks like the commenter disappeared).  I have read about and seen accounts from transgender service members but I would think that accounts from those who have served alongside transgender service members would be valuable in their own right.  This would include situations that turned out to be problematic as this one sounds like it was.

TransparentLove,Probably a POG who never left the wire. About 80-85% of the Marine Corps population is non-combat support for the combat units. 

TransparentLove,As US Marine who did 3 combat deployments in different war-zones, I vehemently disagree with your position. 

As long as the Marine next me is qualified, proficient, and professional I don't care how they identify or what they have going on under their uniform. If they can do their job well, that's all that  matters to the mission. 
I served during a time when homosexuality could get you kicked out. We had a Marine in our unit that came out as bisexual  to a few close squad mates. If he hadn't told us, no one would have been the wiser. He didn't bring it to work, and it never effected his skills and abilities. The same thinking applies to trans people- if you do your job well and don't let it effect your work, then *it shouldn't matter at all.*



None,Turns out the sudden ban was brought on because funding was being requested for DoD transgender sex reassignment surgery. What a ridiculous waste of tax payer money. Now I am even more grateful Trump reversed Obama's decision

TransparentLove,Away with you vile human. 

None,US Taxpayers should not be on the hook for expensive hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery.  There is nothing vile with that position.  Those people should have to pay for it themselves.

IronMyr,It's literally a fifth of the money the US Military spends on Viagra.

Also, nobody asked you.

None,Pointing to wasteful spending in one area does not justify wasting money in another area.  That's the logic of idiots.

IronMyr,How is paying for soldiers' healthcare a waste? I for one support our troops.

None,There is a difference between paying for necessary procedures and elective procedures.
Transgender reassignment and hormone therapy is an elective medical procedure, I don't care what any liberal doctor/politician/whoever says.
That would be like saying breast augmentation surgery is necessary. It's not.  People need to pay for their own elective procedures.  We are already $20 trillion in debt, we shouldn't be accelerating this sort of spending nonsense.

I support our troops too, by keeping out transgender people so we can minimize distractions and wasteful spending to free up money for more important things.

IronMyr,I didn't realize that you cared so little about our troops. What, do you only want to keep them alive? Do you not care about their combat effectiveness? Do you even recognize their humanity?

None,>I didn't realize that you cared so little about our troops.

Proud veteran here who now works with many other veterans at an Aerospace and Defense company that makes body armor and related items for our troops.  I work tirelessly, year after year, to provide our customers excellent products and service.  We take  a lot of pride in the work we do for the US soldier.  My support for banning transgender people from the military comes from the fact that I know, as a veteran and who knows many veterans, that transgender people are a distraction and a burden for our military force.  I work with many veterans and the ones I have discussed this with all agree.

"when asked how the policy allowing transgender individuals to serve openly "affected military readiness," 41 percent said it "hurt" while 12 just percent said it "helped."

http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/what-did-service-members-think-of-the-obama-era-transgender-military-policy/article/2629741

Transgender people have a lot of problems, way more than the average person.  Including them in the military ranks weakens the military effectiveness.  It's a fact.

"Psychiatrists and researchers have long known the high rate of suicide and attempted suicide among transgenders. Some experts attribute these tendencies to deep inner conflict and others say transgenders are suicidal because of a lack of acceptance in society at large. The NCTE survey found 39 percent of transgenders report serious recent psychological stress (eight times the 5 percent rate of the average American)."

"Fully 40 percent admitted to attempting suicide — nine times more common than the average citizenry (4.6 percent). Seven percent attempted suicide in the past year, which is 12 times the average rate (0.6 percent)."

"Additionally, the survey confirmed the astronomical rates of HIV infection: five times the general population (1.4 percent vs. 0.3 percent). It lists 3.4 percent of transgender men (men living as if they were women) having HIV, and an incredible 19 percent of black men living as women — nearly one in five — having the life-threatening precursor to AIDS.

"Twelve percent of transgender respondents report prostituting themselves (the NCTE calls prostitution "sex work in exchange for income"). More than three-quarters (77 percent) have experienced partner violence."

https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/transgender-survey-reveals-high-rates-of-sexual-assault-suicide-hiv-prostit

People with all these problems weaken would weaken any military force.

http://sandrarose.com/2016/07/military-leaders-criticize-obama-for-allowing-transgenders-in-the-military/




TransparentLove,1. Hormone therapy isn't expensive. The 'burden' of providing transgender healthcare and services to active duty members is an increase of about $6 million annually. The study concluded that these increases would only represent between 0.005 to 0.017 percent of overall Department of Defense health care expenditures, which totaled $49.3 billion in 2014. 
http://people.com/politics/transgender-soldiers-military-cost-donald-trump-claims/

2. Not all trans people undergo gender confirming surgery. Many have no desire to ever go under the blade. 

3. Service-members pay taxes too, so in a way they are contributing to their own healthcare costs. 

4. You and other taxpayers are already paying for transgender people's medical care. Medicare covers gender confirming surgeries. 
https://www.priorityhealth.com/provider/manual/auths/~/media/documents/medical-policies/91612.pdf
https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/30/5765288/medicare-will-now-cover-transgender-surgical-procedures

5. The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is funded by taxpayers like you. The VA offers transgender services, medical care, and transition assistance. So again, you're already 'paying for their care'.

6. If you are still concerned about the financial impact of 'your tax dollars' covering active duty service-members transitions, read this.

The military is a fighting force, not a gender clinic.

2)  OK.  That's good.  But Transgender people have more than their share of problems that come with a host of costs.  This transgender person agrees  http://dailysignal.com/2017/07/26/why-forcing-the-military-to-pay-for-sex-changes-would-be-disastrous/

3) That's logic doesn't make sense.  Let them work some where else and be a financial burden on that organization.

4) It would be great if Trump could stop that coverage too, but it is unlikely because with his military argument, he can cite the negative effect the transgender person has on the military combat readiness.  He can't make that argument to cut them from other government medical care....unfortunately.

Zero_Gh0st85,What do you all think about someone who doesn't think it's right to use taxpayer dollars to pay for the Trans related surgeries? It's expensive, no?  

alphabetsuperman,That's a completely different issue. This is banning them from serving in *any capacity,* not restricting what their insurance covers. Estimates have also showed that we're talking about less than 0.02% of the military healthcare budget here. The argument that it's about cost is a blatant lie that doesn't hold up to even basic scrutiny. 

FlorencePants,I think they can go fuck themselves.

They're fine letting taxpayer dollars go into building more, bigger bombs, shitty jets that don't work, a fuck ton of tanks we don't need, etc.

But taking care of trans soldiers? Woah there, bucko, we're not MADE of money!

Zero_Gh0st85,You don't see the difference between  a military spending money on bombs and tanks versus funding someone's sex change? 

FlorencePants,I definitely see the difference. The latter kills far less people.

IronMyr,Yeah, one of those things doesn't get parked in the desert until it's outdated.

Zero_Gh0st85,Right. Okay. 

uptotwentycharacters,Doesn't the military already provide healthcare for its members? I don't see why this should be any different. Besides, it's not really about the cost of medical care - it's a complete ban on trans people serving in the military, rather than just the military refusing to pay for transitioning - which means even trans people who are willing to pay all medical expenses themselves aren't allowed to serve. And paying for medical care of trans service members is probably one of the *least* controversial things the military does with taxpayer money.

Yes.  That is exactly why we're happy!  She was elected on her merits!  Her opponent ran on the "issue" of her gender, and the voters agreed that that was a stupid thing to make the election about.

spacemoses,Well, Trump is kind of the ranking officer, so...

NeedMoneyForVagina,The president doesn't have as much power as you might think they do. Nothing ever just goes through one person. 

Poster3433,Congress is the ranking officer here, and they control the purse strings.

ClearlyBanned22,Literally the commander in chief, he is the head of the military, what he says goes.

kurisu7885,That might hold some weight with people if he had every actually served.

ClearlyBanned22,Who cares if he served or not, there are 14 presidents in history who have zero military experience, including Obama, Clinton, and FDR.

It doesn't matter if you think it holds weight or not, Trump is in charge of the military and if he says trans people present an issue for military effectiveness then he is absolutely allowed to do so.

Amelia_Frye,Following corrupt orders is about as bad as making corrupt orders. They won't follow through with this, because the cost is enormous compared to the benefits.

xijie,Like they said, this is a tweet, not an order.  General Mattis is on leave - I'm sorry.  Secretary Mattis is on vacation.  That said, while there may be some dragging of feet, if the commander in chief gives an order, the military needs to follow unless it's a serious war crime.

Ultimately, Mattis may talk Trump out of this, or he may mitigate the consequences, or he go along with it.  We don't know and won't until anything solid is announced.

WinterAyars,They'll follow through if given direct, formal, specific orders i'm sure. Doing otherwise would basically be a coup, if done by the leaders. As (temporarily) relieving as it would be to watch Trump getting dragged out into the streets, that's not the outcome we want. (There seem to be a *lot* of outcomes we don't want, these days.) Anyway, this is a welcome change from the TSA going Hulk rage mode the instant Trump gave that EO to go after Muslim travelers. Really highlights the differences...

CedarWolf,> They'll follow through if given direct, formal, specific orders i'm sure.

Not true. Part of a soldier's duty is to ensure the orders he is following are legal and lawful orders. They have a mandate to ignore or reject orders that aren't legal.

The_Rejected_Stone,tweets aren't orders though

NerdyKirdahy,He himself is hardly able to string 140 characters together coherently, but being president, he might still be able to get someone else to write the orders for him to just sign.

Of course, he may end up accidentally giving Bannon national security clearance again.

Shakooza3858,Trump is the commander and chief. They will do exactly as he commands or they will face court martial...

Im not making a statement about my personal feelings on Transgenders in the military. If you are able body you should be able to serve your country.

Chatmauve,Last I checked, Twitter isn't an official channel. 

If it were, you could simply guess that his password is "hunter1", tweet "launch all our nukes at Russia" and end the world.

IronMyr,Good thing he has yet to submit an order, then.

TransparentLove,>Transgenders

Transgender is an adjective not a noun. 
Please refrain from using it as such. 

Using it as a noun carries a heavy slur connotation. For example you wouldn't say 
"my personal feelings on blacks in the military" or "my personal feelings on gays in the military" see how inappropriate those statements seem? 

As with any adjective, it should be followed by a noun. 
A better way would be "my personal feelings on transgender individuals in the military" or "my personal feelings on transgender service-members in the military"

I know this comes off as nit-picky.. but words are important and they carry weight and power. I stress that words ought to be used properly in such they are most effective. 

But other than that I strongly agree with your sentiment. 

Shakooza3858,You are right it comes off as nit-picky. I treat ALL people with dignity and respect but I refuse to walk on egg shells. If you are looking to be offended then you will find something to take offense. Im responsible for how I ACTUALLY treat others. Im not responsible for how others interpret my use of adjectives and pronouns.

EthanTheFabulous,I know his reasoning behind it was probably disgusting but should we not question transgender people in the military and the mental issues they probably are already facing? I know nothing about it but do they receive the right amount of counselling or therapy in regards to their transsexualism as well as military related trauma? That's something I'm more concerned about.

MsNatCat,There's thousands of my siblings serving right now and doing amazingly.

It's pretty clear that transgender people can serve without issue.

None,If they're getting hormones and surgery then yes, they've had lots of targeted therapy and assessment. They've received a lot more appropriate and necessary mental health care than the rest of the military. They all need it. 

EthanTheFabulous,Thank you for answering my question. I don't understand why I've been downvoted for being concerned about their mental wellbeing.

None,No problem, it's a touchy topic. Easy to take it the wrong way I guess

Amelia_Frye,Friendly reminder not to read the replies. Such gold as "I just can't agree with you on this" and "the real problem is people who don't like straight people"

I don't like people who ignore my struggles because they got called out on their bullshit and couldn't take it. But sure, my community hates straight people, that's exactly what should be taken from being asked to check your privilege.

friendlessboob,What's wrong with "I just can't agree with you on this"? It's not what you want, but its not toxic, or am i missing something? People are going to disagree

Edit: getting downvotes for acknowledging that I may be missing something

Amelia_Frye,Disagreeing with the fact that gender is a spectrum is nothing like disagreeing on pizza or tea or coffee, things that are actually opinions.

Imagine if that person has a trans kid. Or ever interacts with a trans person. Or votes for candidates based on their disagreement about the gender and sexuality spectrum.

friendlessboob,Gender and sexuality being more complex than A/B is something you and I are comfortable with. 

The idea that *everyone*  will understand this, especially if we won't walk a mile in their shoes, seems counter productive.

I get that humans lack of understanding, empathy or interest in people different from themselves, especially children, has tragic consequences. 

Amelia_Frye,That's like saying it's okay to be anti-science, more specifically flat earth and geocentrism. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of how people work, and even those to the extreme ends of the gender and sexuality spectrum can benefit from understanding it.

friendlessboob,I don't think it's "like saying its okay to be anti-science" to just be able to tolerate someone disagreeing. If you want to bridge gaps you have to be able to hear dissent.

None,> If you want to bridge gaps you have to be able to hear dissent.

"Let's gas just *half* the jews."

friendlessboob,Did you just equate being able to tolerate anyone disagreeing with you as the same as killing 3 million people? Please explain if I am getting that wrong.

None,Oh, it's just a slippery slope, not an equivalence.

friendlessboob,Ah, well that certainly seems less crazy :) To be honest, not sure if I agree, it's tricky to know when are you letting things fall apart and when you are trying to be even handed.

ri-no,You have a right to your own opinions, you don't have a right to your own facts.  To answer your question.

friendlessboob,Appreciate you answering without vitriol, I am sure this is a tough subject for you. 

And, I agree with what you are saying but not sure I understand how that applies here.

If a person thinks that the fact that there are two kinds of genitals *means* there can be only two genders, they didn't get the fact part wrong, they got the meaning part wrong. 


If someone with male genitalia *is* a woman I think they should be able to live as they *are*. But, some people may not agree, or even understand. Saying they have their *facts* wrong, in the same way anti-vaxxers have their facts wrong, doesn't seem like it addresses the problem. 

Keep in mind it used to be seen as a fact that homosexuality was a mental disorder. 


ri-no,The concept of gender existing on a spectrum has nothing to do with genitals.  Binary gender theory says that M and F exist on either end of a line with void between.  In truth, M and F meet in the middle of that line and extend out in either direction.  

On a number line between 1 and a 100, if you're a 1 you're basically John McClane and you eat glass dipped in ghost peppers for breakfast.  If you're a 100 you're Elle Woods and spend most of your disposable income on Marabou slippers and dog sweaters.  Almost none of us exist in the space of those stereotypes.

In truth everyone fits somewhere on that line, but it's almost never on either end.  If you stop and think about it you're probably not even within 10 points of the end of that line.  I myself have always existed somewhere near to the middle.  

Being a transgender woman doesn't mean trying to emulate the Elle Woods of the world, I was born to be a 70/100 tops and that's where I'm comfortable.  Because I don't want to make this a book I'll just say that there are a lot of misconceptions about gender worth examining and probably discarding.  Our current societal expectations are toxic for all involved.  

friendlessboob,Maybe I should have been clearer. I *agree* that gender and sexuality is a spectrum. So that was an eloquent sermon to the choir.

I am talking about people  who don't agree with or understand this concept. 

I think it helps to appreciate where someone is coming from if you want to change their view. Just saying **wrong** sounds like a certain shitbag that we allowed to be president.

Edit: clearly, you are not just saying *wrong*, you very thoughtfully explained your point, was referring to my original question

ri-no,My response, as well as Adam's tweet stating that gender exists on a spectrum are objectively true.  You can't agree or disagree with objective reality.  Not cogently anyway.

friendlessboob,It feels like we may be talking past each other. We both agree on what is true. We are not connecting on how to address people who don't agree, and maybe that's enough for now.

ri-no,Your original question was why is "I disagree with that" wrong. My answer is that disagreeing with objective reality isn't possible in the literal sense.  I tried to make that point by showing that Adam Savage's tweet was objectively true, and by also stating that you can't argue or disagree with objective truth.

friendlessboob,My original question was why "I just can't agree with you on this" was so unacceptable that you should avoid reading the comments on the original tweet. 

Repeatedly saying "you can't argue with objective truth" doesn't address that. Which is why I said we are talking past each other.

ri-no,I misunderstood your question to mean, why is it so bad that it should be ignored (i.e. not addressed).  Now it makes more sense.  I agree with you, that's a pretty tame comment from the dozen or so I read before hating myself for reading them in the first place.

friendlessboob,Hey, we in this together. Although I am wondering why a person who can have discourse, especially one involving disagreement, and be able to take a step back and look at things differently is on reddit. : )

ri-no,I'm not always sure what I'm doing here either ;P  

Bucklar,"Do not read the replies"...except the ones you're going to copy and paste for us to read? :P

> that's exactly what should be taken from being asked to check your provelege

Once it becomes clear that a certain expression causes a very specific reaction in an enormous chunk of people, it might be time for us to retire it and/or choose a new expression. Trans people should know better than anyone that whether we like it or not, the speaker doesn't get to choose how a listener will interpret what they say. People don't ever react well to outright belligerence or snark, and "check your privilege" communicates both pretty strongly.

AmIMtF,"NO SOURCES????" 140 characters

plazmablu,Seems odd that someone would say they "disagree" with Adam on this. You can't agree or disagree with the existence of NB people. It's like saying "I disagree with the existence of Welsh people"... It's not an opinion or a hypothesis, it's a well known and studied fact that they exist. 

MisfortunateFox,There's people that disagree that the holocaust happened. People are dumb.

nikkitgirl,Show me the scientific evidence that says someone can be from Wales so I can ignore it and say you're wrong

Dr_Scoobie,Somebody told me they were born in wales once but I dismissed it because it was anecdotal.

EmeraldPen,But there's one study that shows transitioning doesn't help, if you read it in a certain way and ignore every likely cause of suicidality mentioned in the paper that  isn't "mental health!"

foxfire66,What's funny is, from what the study says, it seems to say that suicide rates are not much higher than normal after transition. Pretty sure it says something about suicide rates being higher but for those who transitioned between 1989-2003 it wasn't high enough to be statistically significant. It's almost like treating us like actual people (or closer to it, anyway) or giving us better medical treatment results in less suicides.

TheGuardianReflex,>"the real problem is people who don't like straight people"

*eye twitch*

MisfortunateFox,He responded to that one. Something to the affect of "Yes, hating on straight people is the *real* problem."

threnodis_ocelot,>'I'm not blaming all trans people, but the problem is they blame strait people for not dating trans people'

Yeah... cause gay and lesbian trans people don't exist...
The whole thread turns into people whining about "straight shaming", cause you know, gender is sexual preference...

tkrr,Thing is, those people (most of them TERFs) are just straight up tinfoil hatters. I tangled with one the other day - when I looked at her FB, she turned out to be just as much of a reactionary fuckstick as I thought she was.

Im_a_shitty_Trans_Am,Side note : my favorite conspiracy is that the government puts mind altering chemicals in tin foil and anti EM paint. 

tkrr,Conspiracy theories are a government plot to keep crazy people busy while the government tries to take over the country.

FlorencePants,Don't you know that all trans people transition just to fool straight people into having sex with them, like the world's most elaborate prank? (/s in case that's needed xD)

notyetawizard,Actually, I transitioned to fool lesbians into having sex with me. Oh no, the TERFs were right! :O

threnodis_ocelot,<s> oh no! Fooled me, I thought it was for my well being... guess I have to trick straight guys into the sex acts...</s>

mistlet03,It seems a lot of celebrities have been doing this recently. Bill Nye made a whole episode of his new show about gender and sexuality being spectrums and now Adam Savage is declaring his support. I'm enjoying this trend of badass science dudes lending their support. 

plazmablu,I like how Reddit has suddenly turned on Bill because of this... And they insist that they didn't like the show because it was "tonedeaf" and "condescending"... No, it just challenges their shitty views with science.

MisfortunateFox,I've only seen the dance. I should check out the show because right now I'm not at all a fan (despite the message I agree with, and BILL BILL BILL BILL). I hope the rest isn't so awkward.

alphabetsuperman,The dance number was awkward and weird... but have you ever watched his original show? Every episode was filled with over-the-top cheesy skits and songs just like this. It's part of his bizarre style. This one probably went a little too far and was more uncomfortable than funny, but that's true for a lot of his old songs too. It wouldn't be a Bill Nye show without awkward jokes and music numbers. 

wrathofpie,I can overlook it just because I think most dance routines are like that, lol. I found it super simplistic when I think it could have been expanded further. I know thirty minutes is not a lot, but I thought more could have been done with the time. However, I did like their discussion of South Korea in regards to gender and culture, and I felt the panel was pretty good. I think the perk of this episode was really to expose these ideas to an audience that does not normally hear them from a voice that they would be more likely to listen to.

Avenflar,Guy from r/all here.

I was wondering : do transgender consider their state as a gender in itself, or is it still viewed as "a man/woman in the wrong body"?

dinosawrsareawesome,Tou could almost certainly find a trans person that agreed with the 'ther r only 2 genderz,' meme, trans people are like any group of people, they have differing opinions and worldviews.

_Valhalla_,Varies by individual.

For myself though, my body is my body and I'm very comfortable with it, except for one thing and that is that my biological sex is male and I went through male puberty.

For me trans is an adjective that describes me on a detailed level like the fact that I am polish and Italian, double jointed, and need to wear glasses.

tkrr,My personal take on it is a little different - I see it in terms of hormone receptors being wired backwards, a neurochemical intersex condition. Getting some T&A out of the deal is a side benefit...

wrathofpie,It is very dependent on the person for sure. As a general rule, it would more just be an adjective to describe someone who does not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth, and then man/woman/bigender/agender etc. would be their gender they identify with. However some people do use transgender as an identifier for their gender as well, although you will usually hear it in conjunction with another identity, such as transman or transwoman. Personally I will use it to identify my gender (trans man) but I think a lot of that has been out of necessity, because if I did not qualify it, people would have been super confused. However, nowadays I am almost exclusively seen as male, so I have been doing that less and less since I very rarely have to explain myself anymore.

nikkitgirl,Depends on the person. Personally I see myself as a woman who through an unfortunate birth defect was born with a functional male reproductive system. 

kwilpin,I'm a man who is transgender. I consider it as having the wrong body, but I'm in the minority.

NocturneOpus9No2,"Transgender" itself isn't a gender, but it is a broad term and not all people think of themselves as male or female.

Chocobubba,I don't personally consider "transgender" as a gender, at least not for myself. For me it's a simple way to explain my situation in a way most people can understand. I personally say I'm a girl (I'm MtF) and I have the wrong body.

EmeraldPen,How exactly a person identifies runs the gamut.  

I cant speak to nonbinary stuff, but within the community of folks who identify in a binary manner(i.e. As male or female) attitudes towards their identified gender vary pretty wildly.  Some view being trans as an important part of their identity.  Some view it as being "trapped in the wrong body" as you described.  Others see it purely as a medical condition that needs to be corrected.  It varies according to individual preference, life experience, and even point in transition. 

The unifying theme for binary individuals, though, is that "trans" is an adjective describing their identified gender, not the actual gender one identified with.  It's just how one uses that adjective varies.  

Just as an example, I identify solely as a woman.  I'm 5 years in now since starting HRT, and I view being trans as essentially a medical condition that has affected my life in major ways and that I need Meds for.   Me being 'trans' is only relevant as far as doctors, girlfriends, and my politics are concerned.  Being gay is a far bigger part of my identity than being trans is.

Stef-fa-fa,"Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e. the state of being male, female or an intersex variation which may complicate sex assignment), sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles), or gender identity.[1][2][3] Some cultures have specific gender roles that can be considered distinct from male and female, such as the hijra (chhaka) of India and Pakistan." - Wikipedia

these are the sort of comprehensive, peer reviewed studies that inform court decisions that the anti transgender lobby cannot produce, so they lie instead.

As per the Australian Psychological Society :

> To date there have been no robust empirical findings demonstrating therapeutic success in
directing transgender people to live as the gender normatively expected of the sex they
were assigned at birth. By contrast, a growing body of empirical research has demonstrated
that affirming clinical responses can make a significant positive contribution to the mental
health of transgender people.

Daniel Shumer, and Norman Spack support this conclusion:

> We believe that treatment of adolescents with GID using these guidelines results in
diminished sex dysphoria, improved psychological functioning, enhanced ability to ‘pass’ for
the desired sex without expensive and unsatisfying cosmetic procedures and overall
improved quality of life

Psychiatrist and gender dysphoria specialist Esther Gómez-Gil states that:

> Data reflect that transsexuals attending a gender identity unit reported subclinical levels of
symptoms of anxiety and depression. Moreover, patients who had not initiated cross-sex
hormonal treatment reported higher levels of social distress, anxiety and depression than
patients under cross-sex hormonal treatment.

If you are going to try and convince me a shitposter on reddit knows more than the combined knowledge of all our mainstream medical, psychiatric and psychological bodies, you are going to have to try a heck of a lot harder.

At least try and argue coherently. Also, "Tranny" doesn't really apply as I myself am not transgender, but a researcher.

I honestly wonder what leads to such a major societal and intellectual breakdown to produce people like you. 

Do me a favour, take a step away, read a book, get some air, and ask yourself, really ask yourself, if this is the person you want to be.

EllieMayT,The group I know has the two fries stands I mentioned the baseline burgers across from flying dog and one of the Rita cabanas (and most recently the Eutaw street grill aka bacon on a stick) 

Basically look for the hats that aren't Orioles...the group I know are FUNraising but there are other groups and they all have their own hats

mingram,Wait what? Really? That doesn't make any sense. 

EllieMayT,They're "non profits" so it's a group that runs the stand 

Honestly don't know how to fully explain it because I barely understand it

mingram,I am surprised they aren't more hawkish if they are based on commission. 

EllieMayT,It's split commission among the group but also the food sells itself

cooltreasures,Try 'em again! Every time I've gotten them they've been nice and warm. They keep the crab dip in a soup pot so I dunno why you got the cold stuff.

hannahmadamhannah,Yeah you're definitely thinking of the chipper which, tbh, sucks. The crab dip fries are warm and melty and barely crab and are amazing.

MarcoPolo10,Maybe the chipper thinks you suck. /s

hannahmadamhannah,Maybe the chipper is right :( BUT who puts cold crab meat on warm chips?! It's a weird combination.

MarcoPolo10,It's like ceviche!

ElBomberoLoco,It could be worse.....it could be the horrible "crab fries" they serve at Citizen's Bank Park in Philly. There is no crab. They just sprinkle Old Bay on French fries.  

Gevamna,Old bay fries for $9. Philly acts like they created the idea too 

flyingturdmonster,Are you thinking of the crab chips from The Chipper? Those are just kettle chips with cold crab meat on them (and incredibly disappointing, imo). The dip they put on the Chesapeake fries is normally very hot and is more liquidy/creamy.

ray52ray27,100% warranted. Baltimore baby!

RonRizzle,I'm just now hearing about this, what's the history?

ominous_anonymous,Another aspect to know is the Royals players are very in-your-face with their emotions (confidence or arrogance, your choice...) and their pitchers have a history of throwing at a lot of teams.  This is just one of the multiple times they threw at an Orioles batter last year (one of which was Manny):  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZmRkLwAzHc  
  
So it's not like the Orioles anger came out of nowhere.

orioles0615,Ventura gets upset when you hit a ball up the middle at him.

ChezapeakeMC,I was at this game. Ventura was pitching Manny inside all night. Completely intentional and I have no problems with Manny charging the mound. 

Colebert_herbst,Ventura is a bitch. Manny is a hot head out to prove hes the best.  Ventura has a history of throwing at hitters because they talk shit.  Manny wants to prove that he won't back down.  Mid game Orioles are winning by 5.  Manny already almost hit one out on Ventura, as well as almost got hit.  Next time up, first pitch, got plunked.  Manny chased him down, dodged and landed a decent strike.  Ventura knocked him down because he's a pussy and can't fight.  Benches cleared.  Both ejected. 

I think Ventura already has had a suspension of 7 games for doing the same thing.  Manny got a few games for throwing a bat at donaldson last year or the year before. 

Manny will prob get 3 games.  Ventura probably/hopefully 10, 15 maybe, 20 hopefully.  

darkenfire,You really think Ventura will get more than Manny!

PIG20,Definitely.  Even if you watch the video, it was Ventura who threw the first punch.  Not to mention inciting the whole thing to begin with.  Add to the fact that Ventura has been ejected now from at least 4 games going back to last season and faced a 7 game suspension, he'll be looking at 10 games at least for this incident.  

If Manny's record was clean, he might have gotten off easy with a couple games but I think we'll be seeing 5 for him.  Which could really have serious implications for those 5 games.  

However, I don't see how this confrontation would have been avoided.  Ventura was egging him on and with Manny's demeanor, this outcome was inevitable.  

darkenfire,Haha, yeah. Jones said he knew it was going to happen before the AB.

Wvuvt1,He should. It's not manny's fault the dude was a bitch and can't fight. What is manny supposed to do, just allow people throwing 99 mph hit him. Even Buck said he isn't mad at manny in post game

darkenfire,Yeah, and after I said that I saw about the dude's history, so he'll get worse for that.

jayhawx19,Yordano is a fucking idiot and I don't support his blatantly intentional beaning of Machado. That being said, yes, you are supposed to go to 1st base as compensation when you get hit. Charging the mound is not necessary, though it is understandable. He knows full well he was gonna get hit with a suspension for it, and I think it was worth it to teach Ventura a lesson.

Rafa_Nadals_Eyebrow,You just take it and go to first base when it's an accident. When you get intentionally beaned and it's not even the first time you've been plunked by this guy, you try to beat the shit out of him. 

LaDunkelCloset,He was targeted and essentially assaulted.  However, there was no threat after the throw. I wish Machado would have walked away but I dont blame him for being so obviously targeted.  It is difficult.  They both deserve suspension.

m311owout,It's what happens when Ventura decides to not follow the unwritten rules and acts like a non-professional. Then there's unwritten consequences.

pancakeNate,If punching a guy after he intentionally drills you with a 99mph heater is wrong, I don't want to be right. Manny's a big boy and I'm glad he handled it on the spot. Problem solved, nobody else needs to get drilled.

CostasPinkEye,Yes, pitchers in this situation usually get 10 games as it will mean they will miss two starts.

darkenfire,Oh that makes sense. Have to suspend 10 games for him to actually miss 2.

None,Ventura came close to hitting Machado on Monday too, and hit both Davis and Machado last season, according to [this article](http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/16031510/manny-machado-charges-mound-punches-yordano-ventura-plunking)

ominous_anonymous,It goes all the way back to 2014.  And everyone quickly forgets that Ventura was ejected twice and suspended last year for hitting batters and inciting brawls.  This isn't new behavior, it is entirely on Ventura.

jayhawx19,Ventura has pulled this shit against numerous teams. We are tired of his shit. Sports talk radio on my way home here in KC was getting callers advocating for a month suspension. He's a punk and I'm glad Machado rocked him in the fight. All that being said, they will both get punished because they both did something to start the fight despite Ventura's track record of being a punk. Maybe they'll tack on some extra ones for him because of his history, missing one start isn't enough.

barscarsandguitars,They should just kick him out of the league. If he's done the same thing over and over with no signs of complying with rules other than serving his suspensions, he's a threat. I was a pitcher and never hit anyone, and I was only throwing in the low 80's at my fastest. You hit someone the wrong way with a 100+ MPH ball, they can die. Yes, it's unlikely, but it can happen. 

socsa,MLB really needs to send a message that starting pitchers can't play "rotation arithmetic" with rivals to justify throwing at them.  Ventura did exactly what he hoped to do - he effectively got Manny benched for a week or more, which loses the Orioles more aggregate WAR than his suspension will, even if he is suspended for a month.  Repeat offenders like him won't learn unless these suspensions are 30, 60 even 90 games (without pay, plus fines), because I guarantee you that in his mind, he's buying his team a small strategic advantage by taunting a position player into a suspension.   

allirow,Trust me when I say a vast majority of the dislike that comes from our sub to yours is not KC Royals hate, but Ventura hate.

PIG20,I saw an interview with Ned Yost after the game yesterday and the reporter asked him "are the guys tired of this stuff (from Ventura)?"

Yost didn't even try to hide it.  He pretty much said "yeah, the guys are tired of this stuff."

All Ventura is doing now is making his hitters a target for the other teams pitchers.

I'm not going to sit here and say Manny is an angel by any means as he's done some stupid stuff.  But last night, his actions were warranted IMO.  Just sucks that he'll definitely be getting suspended.

ominous_anonymous,Glad to hear that, especially after listening to Yost do everything he could to blame Manny in his post game interview.  I wonder if some voodoo magic could make Ventura disappear and speed up Moustakas and Gordon returning for you guys.

jayhawx19,Can't blame us for trying to act like it was unintentional for the time being haha. Moose is done for the year, but maybe Gordon can come back sooner with the voodoo magic lol.

Thunder_Thighs,THIS SORT OF MAKES UP FOR THE RAVENS GAME TODAY! AND BY SORT OF I MEAN IT DOES!

romorr,It was great, I was prepared to be disappointed X2, poor Detroit, they got the 0-2 today.  Losing to the Bills at home?  Ouch.

I haven't even thought about the Ravens, I guess tomorrow will change that.  What a shit game though.

mikey_mcbutt,That game was a coin-toss anyway. @Indy with a questionable secondary?

But look at the rest of our schedule! Ravens could very realistically go 11-5. Lose @CIN, @PIT, and @NO. 

Chargers? Sorry dudes, we're not playing you in December. Lolphins? Bucs? The rest of the AFCS? We got this!

mrpoppadopalis,Didn't look like anyone got escorted out stay classy

unobserved,I've seen plenty of people get escorted out of the dome for touching balls in play or throwing paper airplanes.

There were cameras all over the place. You can absolutely guarantee he got tossed.

radiofreejoe,He was sent out in cuffs, they said it in the broadcast

None,[deleted]

Strawberrysplat,Don't try to act like that was the reason you lost. Suck it up,stop crying,  and stop being an immature little bitch about it. You guys lost today because your offense wasnt performing and could only provide 4 hits and 2 runs in an 11 inning game so its not Ubaldos fault either.

ryulaaa,And buck is a shit manager 

joey4track,I'll still take Buck over that sorry sack of shit Gibbons.

ryulaaa,Good for you 

flexosgoatee,3 x manager of the year. Those who know disagree with you.

totmacherX,Wasn't the reason we lost, but if one of your Jays players had a beer thrown at him, don't you think you would be a little upset at the fanbase attending the game? Couple that with the beer throwing during last year's AL playoff game and us fans in Baltimore are starting to see a playoff trend.

Hot_Wheels_guy,Why are you posting in /r/orioles right now?  You're a fucking sore winner.  Go bandwagon with your fellow bandwagoners in your own sub.  

Xingua92,He is definitely a sore winner, so embarrassing to see fellow fans act like this. Of course we would be upset if someone threw a beer can at our players and your feelings are not illegitimate at all in that sense.

/u/strawberrysplat no one here has suggested that their team lost because of a beer can. They are expressing anger over clearly bullshit and aggressive behavior. Now stop embarrassing us and leave the trash talk for our own sub. It's really tasteless to come here and do this.

cujo8400,There are asshole fans everywhere. I'm sure you have a few in Baltimore as well. 

Hot_Wheels_guy,> There are asshole fans everywhere.

Sure that's a fun and easy way to cop out of an actual discussion about fan misbehavior, but the truth is I don't recall any incidents involving Orioles fans throwing shit at players in the last decade or so.  If you can find a video or article proving otherwise I'll gladly concede my point. 

cujo8400,[I will let Keith Olbermann make the case.](https://youtu.be/EcmgOAA_USA) The part about Baltimore starts around 2 minutes. 

The point is, the bad behaviour of a few doesn't speak for the rest of the people who don't have their heads up their asses.
